    <h2>Arc 1- Introduction</h2>
    <p>

      <br />
      <br />
      Grey, Ali, Griffin, Stephine, Alvin, Aria and Jessika are introduced.
      Stephine has daddy issues and Alvin is a jeark so she breaks up with him.
      Stephine then hears about her father in news about his company that he
      used to work in. He suddenly became the ceo a few months ago since the
      original leader died a long time ago leaving the company owner less. The
      comapny was shut down but it got reopend. Stephine then talk to her
      friends about a party where they need to bring their partners. But
      stephine doesn't have any partner so she decided to pretend she already
      have a new bf. She pretends to keep it a secret. They plan to meet again
      tomorrow to disscus whom to bring. Stephine is in problem cause she
      doesn't knows whom to bring. She can't go around asking everyone cause
      it'll reveal that she doesn't have a partner.
      <br />
      <br />
      While she was walking around the school a guy named robert was looking at
      her in a wierd way. Stephine then saw grey and thought she never talked to
      grey well so decides that grey will be her next target. While walking to
      home grey finds he is being followed by stephine but doesn't reacts and
      stays nutral. Stephine can't take the awkwardness. She can't believe grey
      is doing this to her since grey has always been the type of guy to always
      smile and laugh no matte what. She breaks the silence by her cute talk and
      grey instantly realizes that she's trying to sweet talk but grey is not in
      the mood. Stephine tries to act cute but grey tells her that if she's
      goanna pretend to be a cute girl then she can live her delusional life but
      bother others is not some short of acomplishment. She should stop.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine asks if guys doesn't likes cute girls. Grey explains her the
      difference between fantacy and reality. Grey explains her about some stuff
      which they talk for a while. Grey doesn't like any pretend girl so no
      matter what motive she may have she can go home. Grey doesn't likes liers
      and lies. Stephine promices not to pretend and grey agrees to listen.
      Stephine having no way accepts her way and explains that she wants to go
      to a party where she promiced her friends. Grey tells her to get a real bf
      then. Stephine explains that's what she was trying to do in the first
      place but grey says he's going there regardless so it's better to take her
      with him. Stephine doesn't understands and grey explains that alvin
      invited him there regardless if he have any partner or not. To be honest
      it's actually not a requirement as long as you got an invitation.
      <br />
      <br />
      At night stephine was at her room thinking how grey gave her his number
      and she feels like a fool since she didn't knew that it wasn't a
      requirement to bring a guy. But regardless she promiced to bring one so
      she will now. She rememberd how their first interaction went. Stephine
      remembers how grey at first came to be a quiet guy whom she tried to be
      friend but grey din't even talked nicely to her which made stephine angry
      and she decided never to talk to grey thinking what kind of loner guy grey
      might be but she was surprised. Soon the entire classroom was taken over
      by grey's laughter. He looked like the happies person in the world every
      guy being his friend and every girl talking how stupid and smart grey is
      sometimes. The teachers are satisfied by grey's grades but no one ever
      heard about grey's parents as if they don't exist. Once alving asked grey
      about his parents but grey didn't even reacted and said his father went to
      get the milk when grey was born and his mother had the milk. That guy is
      unbelieveable. It's a wonder how he exists. Steying too positive always
      without a care in the world.
      <br />
      <br />
      The next day robert is seens with some people talking shit. Robert is
      tasked to follow a girl and learn as much information about her possible.
      On the other hand stephine called grey to come to a specifiq place and
      grey thought it was an emergency but it wasn't. It was supposed to be a
      date. Grey didn't wanted to go but since he's already here he goes there
      anyways. Stephine talks and talks and visits various places during their
      dates and grey didn't said much. Stephine was getting bored which is when
      grey exposed himself. He told stephine that grey never had any girlfriend
      in his life and probapally doesn't want it. And things like date goes over
      his brain. Grey lived his life as a self centered person and being in a
      relationship will only be wasting time since grey doesn't likes
      socializing. Grey only loves food and talking to his friends. Other than
      that talking to girls and stangers or even having a girlfriend sounds too
      much to him.
      <br />
      <br />
      He tells stephine that now a days people usually only care about fun or so
      on in relationship but grey doens't likes that idea. Grey thinks he's
      boring stephine so Grey tells stephine that there is probapally better
      guys out there so... Stephine understands what grey is trying to say. Grey
      tells stephine that if she wishes they can go together at the party which
      stephine refuses. Stephine is sad. It's night time. Stephine returns to
      reality and hears her mother calling her to get dinner. She was offended
      by her mother's yapping and called out what kind of a bitch she is why her
      father left them. Her mother tells her that her father was the worse
      person since it's been years since he left and never returned. Now this.
      She calls her mother a lier and leaves since she loved her father but he
      left after having an arguement with her mother. Stephine wished her mother
      didn't lied and told her the truth.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine wonders if grey doesn't tells lies since he dispises them.
      Stephine wonders if she should apologise to him since all the guys she
      meet are jearks but grey actually seemed to care. Many he was right.
      relationship is like arrange marrage. You won't know if you need eachother
      until you lived together. She remembers her happy times until she falls
      asleap. On the other hand a girl is seen who is around 13 or so old with
      white hair. Her mother is driving the car and she is arguing with her
      husband for some reason. The car brake isn't working and the car crashes.
      Leaving only the little girl alive. The next morning she get's messege
      from her friends. She leaves the house to go to a cafe she promiced to
      meet her friends. While leaving stephine meets her neighbour robert.
      Robert is a nasty guy who asks stephine where she is going. Stephine
      doesn't likes robert a bit and thinks he's wierd so she leaves without
      replying. Robert one day even proposed stephine which stephine dispices.
      <br />
      <br />
      She is sad cause she doesn't thinks she is getting the love she deserves.
      Aria and Jessiak are with her. Stephine asked both of them about grey and
      if she should start dating with him since he seems like a nice person.
      They talk and jessika reveals that grey used to talk to her before but
      after a while they stopped talking. that was 5 years ago. They argue more
      and then they conclude that it's upto her to ask grey. Jessika asks if
      stephine wants to meet up a new guy but stephine rejects the idea.
      Stephine wants to know about grey but mysteriously they don't know a thing
      about grey. that surprises all of them cause they didn't realized it until
      now but is grey trying to hide his identity. Stephine says that grey is
      probapally too shy to express his feelings. Aria suggests that they should
      call grey right now and ask questions since they can't just leave out
      questions that are important. They call grey and grey answers.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey is told to meet up a certain place which is not too far away from
      grey's current location. Grey asks if there is any guy. Since there isn't
      he doesn't want to. Aria talks about alvin. Alvin can't come since he's
      doing tution studies. Ali can't because he's taking are of stuff. Maybe
      griffin. Grey rejects the idea since he doens't likes him. All three girls
      were confused since they didn't knew that grey didn't had a good relation
      with griffin. Maybe it's cause he shares the same name as his father. They
      then walk out of the cafe after a while of talking and they met grey since
      he went outside to buy a keyboard. It was a surprise.

      <br />
      Stephine is seen dressing up. A flashback is seen. Stephine's friend aria
      tells stephine not to hicken out and go talk to grey directly about her
      feelings and it goes as it should. Stephine talks to grey and they decided
      to give eachother one more try. It's better to fail than not try at all.
      Grey accepts and stephine eventraully decided to go to the party. Stephine
      is ready to leave for the party but her mother tells her to stay for a
      while for whoever is going to pick her. Her mother mocks her for having a
      lot of relations and it angers stephine so she decided to leave rightaway.
      <br />
      <br />
      On the other side grey forgot to bring his phone from home. Stephine is
      constantly trying to call grey but he isn't picking up. Grey decided to go
      to a near by store to get some chips since it's goanna be late meal for
      him today. On this side stephine doesn't feels so good and she then
      realizes someone is following her. It's robert. Robert then goes toward
      stephine to ask her where she is going which frightens stephine. Stephine
      doesn't says and angryly asks why robert is following her. Robert only
      says one thing and that is that he wants to just talk to her but that's
      not the truth so stephine starts running slowly. She is terrifies. She
      soon found out she is in great danger. A stalker is stalking her and
      there's no telling what he might do to her. She is running and running and
      running. She threw her shoes shince it's hard to run with it on. She's
      running for her life. She doesn't realizd her feet are bleeding.
      <br />
      <br />
      She bumps into a person. It's none other than grey. Stephine was so scared
      that she started crying. Grey was confused since he didn't knew who was
      chasing her. On the other side robert is pissed. He didn't expected
      stephine to get so afraid. After all he loves her and wants to do
      something with he which is why he was following her today. He thought once
      they done it she'll be forced to love him which is cursed way of thinking.
      A guy came and touched robert's shoulders and robert got shocked to see
      him and asked what he wants and the guy was actually angry at robert so he
      told robert something and then shot him to head.
      <br />
      <br />
      On this side stephine and grey were going to the party. Stephine was
      wearing grey's shoes and grey asks her if it's really that important to go
      to the party. Stephine explains that she doesn't want to look vaunarable
      by her friends. Grey asks if that really matters right now since she needs
      to take care of her physical and mental health. Grey then talks about
      robert how he's a wierd nobody who does cursed stuff for teenagers and
      grey doesn't likes him at all. He likes to pretend always to be good
      towards parents or other's or even other people which grey waht grey
      hates. A person who isn't good wears a fake mask of kindness. Stephine
      calls grey selfish since he is. Grey says he likes being selfish since his
      selfishness isn't hurting anyone or he isn't backstabbing people out
      there. Grey then asks stephine what kind of way she thinks since grey
      doesn't understands how play girl or boys like her thinks. Grey believes
      that you only need one girlfriend to text and talk to and stay loyal to
      her the rest of your life if you love her. That's how grey thinks.
      Stephine claims that she believes like that too but she always tried to
      find love for herself since her father left her. Maybe she isn't so
      different from grey at all. Selfish.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey explains that relationships should be like arrenge marrake so you can
      get attached to eachother. There is an option to break up so you don't get
      into toxic relations. Stephine agrees with grey 100%. She explains that
      she likes grey's idea and wants to spend time with him if he wants. If
      it's really a arrange marrage thing grey wants. Stephine thinks freaks
      like robert only one thing and grey says that- "I can't say I'm any
      different from them. After all i also may want that one thing. I'll be
      lying if I don't." Stephine says she'll be more than happy to give that
      want to grey which fluster's grey. Grey so accepts her proposal and tells
      her that they may live together for a few days then to see if they are
      good. On the other side alvin is taking care of management along with ali
      griffin and few other people. Alvin asks where grey is since he's nowhere
      to be found. Aria explains that stephine is brining him which surprises
      alvin as well as doens't. He's confused. Alvin the expresses his sadness
      for grey since that guy never got into a relationship due to the fear of
      heart break and not he is finallly having a relation with the killer witch
      of heartbreaks. That's so sad for alvin. The boys started doing their
      thing. Soon a doorbell is heard. Grey came which was happy thing but what
      came was surprising. Stephine was bleeding on her feet. Grey explained
      that she stripped and fell and lost her shoes. Both of them. Everyone
      wanted answers but grey took stephine to a private place to bandage her
      feet.
      <br />
      <br />
      While bandaging stephine asked grey that she thought grey neveer lied. She
      said tha tout of joke but grey took that seriously and told stephine that
      grey doesn't likes to lie. He dispises it since he's been a lier his
      entire life which surprises stephine. She told grey that she was joking
      and grey replied that he wasnt and explained that grey is bad at catching
      upto jokes. Stephine insted of getting angry she's symphotises with grey.
      She's happy to stay by grey's side if he needs her. They then went to
      enjoy the party which makes grey happy.

      <br />
      Stephine was enjoying the party with her friends but grey was getting
      bored. Few of his friends were dancing and hitting on girls. While other
      few were playing games on mobile. Grey was getting bored so alving ask
      grey to meet him somwhere. They go to the roof top and got food. Grey was
      surprised. He didn't expected them to eat this early. Alving explains that
      he knew grey couldn't handel hunger so they decided to do this in the name
      of their four friends. Grey, alving, griffin and ali. Grey was happy and
      smiled. They started talking and joking. Seems like grey is more open
      towards his friends than others. In school Griffin holds first place while
      Ali holds second place. Grey secrainly has the talent to hold first plafce
      and top everyone out but he's lazy so he's fourth place. And alvin's
      place? That's is something they rather not disclose. Arvin was talking
      about the math exam they took last week. Arvin got 67% which is impressive
      for him but grey and griffin were like- Hugh? Ali tried to appreaciate his
      work and griffin started complaining how grey was slacking off. Grey
      explained that he isn't slacking since he got 97% in math. Griffin scolds
      grey since he's so careless that the only misses he did was spelling
      mistake. Griffin seem to have some short of resentment towards grey.
      <br />
      <br />
      Griffin then starts complaining about grey's relation with stephine which
      angers grey. Grey tells griffin to stay away from other people's buisness
      but griffin goes ahead telling grey that she's a worthless girl and it'll
      only ruine his life. Grey doesn't listens and finishes off his food.
      Griffin then complains how grey looks like he's in depressetion which
      confuses all of them. Grey laughs about it and couldn't stop laughing.
      After eveyone had their food ali asks grey what grey dreams to be and grey
      says he doesn't remembers his dream after giving up on it. Ali explains
      that the raeson he asked that question was cause he's going back to
      scollership and going to leave this town. He's thinking about career since
      it's important to know it now. Grey suggests ali that he can play chess
      since there arent many people in their country that plays chess so in
      conrtass he could be the first grandmaster in his country. Ali thinks the
      dream is too big and it's probapally too late for him. Grey explains that
      no dream is small or big. And there no such thing as too late or too soon
      in career or dreams. Only thing that's stopping you should be death. Not
      your passion. Ali likes grey's motivational speech and says he's not sure
      what to do but he'll probapally start playing cheess as a hobby first and
      see if he can go any far.
      <br />
      <br />
      Time passes as they watch the stars in the sky. On the other side Stephine
      was getting worried since she couldn't find grey and grey came down with
      his friends talking nicely which made stephine jealous since grey was
      smiling which made stephine's day. Stephine asks grey to dance with her
      and they all enjoy a nice time. On the other side Robert's mother was sick
      worried since her son always comes home late. Who knows what he's doing
      right now. On the other side a guy was passing by and saw blood and
      figured out there was a deadbody. A person was killed brought day light?
      No. It was probapally night when he died. That guy then calls the police.
      A murder of a high school boy happend. In the morning grey worke up. He
      slept at his friends house where the party was going on. Ali's garage.
      Beside him was none other than stephine which surprises him a bit but he
      sits down. Stephine also wakes up and holds grey's hands. Grey aksed her
      if she has slept with anybody else which stephine replies by saying no.
      Grey wonders if it is a lie but grey has nothing to say even if she did
      since they are like in a contact. The next thing they are doing is walking
      on streets. Stephine is walking on grey's shoes and grey is wearing ali's
      spare slippers. Grey is taking stpehine home to make sure her safety.
      Stephine talked to grey how he didn't even noticed she was sleeping next
      to him at night. Grey asked what will he even do if he noticed her at
      night. The worse he could do is tell her to sleep on the sofa but grey
      would have been probapally the one to sleep on it. Which surprises
      stephine. So she directly asks grey what else they could do. Grey asks if
      it was ok for him to do it. Stephine explains that it wasn't but she
      wanted to know. Grey thought women are complicaed and it's hard to predict
      what they are thinking. Grey explains that he wouldn't even dare to kiss
      her if it turned out to one of her red flags. Stephine explains that grey
      is allowed to kiss her. Grey wonders only. Doesn't does anything without
      any emotion.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine thinks grey is just dum and was going to say something but grey
      kissed her and the told her that grey doesn't knows her house location so
      could she walk a bit faster. Stephine got flustered but started walking
      again. She remembers how others fall for her and she continues the
      dominence but being dominated gives her facination. She likes grey. As
      they walked towards stephine's house they saw a huge crowd and grey was
      confues why there is such a big crowd. Did a person die. If a person did
      then after taking the body there wouldn't be any crowd other than keep out
      poseters. Maybe it's an accident and the crowd is looking at it. Stephine
      goes ahead like a child to see it and grey tries to acompany her and they
      see a dead body. Grey didn't expected a deadbody to stay here even though
      there are police nearby. Grey then tried to tell stephine to get out of
      here since it won't be good for her health but stephine was shocked. She's
      terrified. The person who is present there dead is none other than robert.
      Grey was shocked when he realized it. Grey quickly started calculating.
      Consedering where grey and stephine were last night the road robert took
      to go home. Seems like someone came from behind and shot at his head
      directly. Seems like robert is trying to hold his shoulder.
      <br />
      <br />
      Could the killer be someone robert knew since it can be said that the
      killer came, holeded robert's shoulder to ask him something or talk. Then
      shot of on head since there is clear indication of turning around. But why
      didn't he killed him directly. Was it cause he wanted to talk to him and
      killed him for a quarell. No, the killer was planning to kill him from the
      start since why did he put his hand on his shoulder. So the killer came
      put his hand on robert's shoulder and asked something. Then killed him
      cause that wasn't the answer he was looking for. But why do it at the same
      day robert tried to stalk stephine. Does it has any co relation. A voice
      is heard among the croud. Stephine's mother is here since she was worried
      about stephine. Stephine went to her mother cryingly. On the other hand
      grey decided to talk to the police in charge of the situation and tell him
      what's happend with stephine. After hearing what happend to stephine the
      police in charege Sam asked grey to help them since he's robert's friend.
      Grey tells them that he's happy to help but he isn't his friend. The
      police tries use grey to talk to robert's mother. Grey tells sam to try to
      keep stephine's history secret since it may cause he psychological damage.
      Sam didn't wanted to but due to the kindness of his heart listened to what
      grey told him. They went to robert's house.
      <br />
      <br />
      Robert's mother seemed furious about robert's death and she wanted to find
      the killer of her son. Grey tells sam not to bring up the stalking thing
      since she might go crazy but sam does exactly waht he was told not to
      causing robert's mother to go beserk and started throwing things at him
      since he accused her son to do something so horrible. After hearing how
      robert's mother spolied robert after his father died the police wanted to
      leave but grey insisted on investigating robert's room. They did and they
      found several girls photos and drugs, ciggerets and vape. Illigal videos
      and many stolen items. Robert even had a diary containing personal
      information on many girls. Among them were few names that went missing a
      few months ago. Seems like robert even used to threaten his friends about
      their secrets and got money by that. Sam wanted to put a case on robert's
      mother for being a horrible mother. She let her child do such things and
      she should definetely go to jail for it. They got out of the place after
      taking robert's mother into custody. Sam concluded that robert is
      connected to a certain group that does illigal stuff like a gang or a full
      fledged organization. He definetely purchased drugs and dealing with this
      case may give Sam a good promotion if he manages to solve it. This robert
      opend an entire stalking department it seems. Even if he was alive he
      would have easliy gotten more than 5 years of jail time since he did many
      crimes including information stealing. Sam thinks of three possibilities.
      <br />
      <br />
      In his time robert theretend many people and made enimies. It could be the
      doing of one of such enimies. So it could be a personal attack. Could be a
      case of bullying. Second. It could be a misshapend between drug dealing.
      Two parties having arguement about debpt robert many have since they
      didn't found any money from robert's body and acording to her mother
      robert didnt' took his purse with him. Third. He many have tried to kill
      someone himself which caused such event. His body was in such a shape it
      can be said that he tried to kill someone and he himself got killed
      insted. Grey declines all three possibilities. Grey knows robert and he's
      not that scary in the school. Evey person he bullies is either under his
      leauge or out of his leauge. It's out of question for a guy to be so
      offended that he tried to kill robert since there is enough people in the
      school who would take action. And even if they didn't there would be a
      good enough news or so since there is no report at all. They could
      consider that such even happend that the victim couldn't even do a thing
      but if that was really the case then how couldn't robert resist. Judging
      by how the body was at ground it's obious that somoene more powerful than
      him holded his shoulder to make sure he couldn't use his hand to resis
      what's about to happen.
      <br />
      <br />
      If he was really stronger than robert then why did he even kill him. Was
      there any resentment among them? Why didn't he just beat him up since
      dominence is better. Someting like killing can't be done so easily just
      cause you felt like it. If it was then he would have got caught. Sam said
      robert could himself tried to kill but robert was stalking stephine and he
      didn't had any guy by that time. Where did he got the gun. Somewhere along
      the road? He was going home after his falure and it's illogical to think
      he thought he could harrase a girl and then go kill another guy in an
      apointment. Austin raises a question that he may have knew that he could
      fail but grey explains that he didn't. If he did then why would he take
      such step against his own neighbour. He can't expect himself to get near
      stephine and do what he wanted to if he really planned ahead to fail. And
      the reason grey declines sam's second theory is cause stephine was stalked
      by robert. If a guy really wanted to give robert apointment for delevery
      then why would he do it in that eact time. Matter of fact it all seemed
      like that guy kept an eye on robert and stepped in cause he saw robert
      doing some misshappen. It was a straight kill cause there was no sign of
      proper resisting. It's clear that someone he knew came and grabbed his
      shoulder.
      <br />
      <br />
      Then after talking a while that guy brough a gun and shot robert for
      something he didn't liked. As if he was trying to confrim something from
      him. Sam tells grey that he may be in good use for him. Grey explians that
      it could be ppossibly a stalking operation to kidnap young girls like from
      an organization. Sam did menthone that some girls went missing a few
      months ago that he found their photos from robert's house. It could be
      that robert had some short of involbement on it. Sam explains that he had
      the same thought but it but actually the truth. He did. They think and Sam
      suggests that it's possible that the reason stephine was attacked was due
      to the fact that she is the daughter of the ceo of a certain company. Grey
      asks if this killer has any patter like what kind of perople he targets.
      It's clear that girls aren't the only thing they target. Sam reveals that
      the killer targets mostly rich people as much as he remembers. After
      finding such thing they even decided to search the entire house. And then
      they found a wierd card looking thing which had a symbol on it which
      shocked grey. Steven noticed it. Grey suddenly started acting starange and
      wanted to go home.
      <br />
      <br />
      He didn't wanted to be involbed into any of this anymore. Sam tried to
      stop him since he still had questions for him but let him go since there's
      nothing he can do against ones will. Sam wondered what the symbol actually
      means and how is greay connected to it. They then went to meet stephine
      and her mother for investigation and stephine and her mother started
      crying due to hearing the insident. Her mother called her dum for trying
      to keep her pride on. The whole sceane turned into a sence of drama. Sam
      told stephine to stay careful since there is a possibility she will be the
      target of somebody consedering what kind of notes robert was keeping. Grey
      was at his house and was trying to run away from something. He looked at
      the dark room and immidiately turned on the light and figured out that the
      room was empty. The ground was empty. Grey though that he doesn't even
      lives in that house anymore and goes to his usual life. There are photos
      of someone in his desk. It's a ripped photo of people. Grey get's a call
      from someone named austin. He asks grey about his well being which grey
      eplains everything that has happend. Austin talks how grey tried to be a
      detective and tried to solve the case and started laughing. Grey told
      austin that he couldn't and can't since he isn't good enough for stuff
      like those.
      <br />
      <br />
      Austin cheers grey us saying that sometimes the general people find
      themselves smarted than the police themselves since being the police
      doesn't mean you have over 200 IQ. Grey says he doesn't wanna talk about
      it and austing asks why grey backed down. Atleast he should have tried.
      Grey explains that he saw something that he didn't wanted to see. Austin
      wanted to know what it was that grey saw and grey explains that he saw
      that one mark again. Austin was shocked. Austin adds up that then this
      case will be linked to that case then. Grey agrees. Austin ends the call
      and picks up a file. Austin remembers that grey was just a child back
      then. The police seem to be up to something. They link up all the previous
      cases and figured out something. Grey was at his house talking to ali
      about the test but grey didn't even knew they had a test. Grey is goanna
      play games all day since he has nothing to do for now. A ring bell is
      heard. The police sam comes in. He sits down and does a little chit chat
      with grey. They linked the previous cases and figured out that the missing
      girls themself doesn't have much co reltaion. Who knows what happend to
      them. But the import thing they found in the sybol was something wierd. It
      links to a case way before 11 years ago when the ceo of the company
      griffin died. The one investigating the case was Austin. Grey's uncle.
      <br />
      <br />
      Sam asks why grey tried to get out of the situation as soon as he saw the
      symbol. Was it cause he knew about the sybol? Sam understands that grey is
      a smart kid and doesn't acts like a third gared. So why didn't he inform
      them. Grey explained that he knew they would get it anyways. Sam asks grey
      why he seems like he has truama over this symbol. Grey looks straight at
      Sams face and says that he should stop assuming things. If they want to
      waste their time by making direction less accusations then they can. Grey
      is free all day. Sam starts asking grey what he's hiding since grey
      clearly knows something about the case. Grey tells sam that since sam
      really thinks grey doens't want to tell sam anything then why is he even
      presting. He clearly has the right to remain silent. Sam tells grey that
      this is not america and they can bring out information if grey is trying
      to act suspecious. Grey tells sam that if he's really that suspecious then
      why can't he go to Austin. He clearly will tell him what he wants to know.
      Won't he? Grey asks same about stephine. Will he reveal her stalking stuff
      to pubic since there will be news about her. Sam explains that they won't
      reveal such even but they will have to inform the higher ups as well as
      contradict it into a report. Sam get's irritated and gets out and tells
      his subordinates to contact Austin.
      <br />
      <br />
      The retired officer. Sam thinks that this is his first case and things are
      already this complicated. He can see things right in front of his eyes yet
      they are so far. It's true then. Things don't always go as you vison then.
      Grey get's conserened. Stephine called grey. Grey asked what she wants and
      she says that they need to plan their next date and grey thought it was
      something they didn't do often but doesn't matter. Right now grey is free.
      Stephine agrees. Before ending the call grey asks stephine what would
      stephine think if grey knew who killer robert and who is probapally trying
      to kill stephine too. Stephine says that if that happens then grey will
      have to work hard to protect her. this responce makes grey happy. A week
      passes by and grey and stephine seem to be gettin in a good relationship.
      Sam is talking with austin. He is talking about everything and the details
      of the murder and after than he asks austin why he is keep refusing to
      tell him about the details of grey involbed into this case. What's his
      deal with all this. Austin asks if Sam took any step in the investigation
      or just came to meet austin after a week of doing nothing. Sam explains
      that it did took a while to talk to austin and select a day to talk but
      apart from that Sam has been taking steps. He inquired the entire area.
      The entire class of robert and even checked the local cctv.
      <br />
      <br />
      It happend exactly like grey said. A guy covering his head came and
      touched robert's shoulders and asked him something. After a few seconds
      out of no where or reason he shot him. It was as if he din't though he
      would kill him but also he knew he would need his gun to kill somone. The
      gun shot was reallly near but for some reason they couldn't retreave any
      finger prints. The guy dissepered and they don't know how. That guy must
      have dissepeared somewhere with less cctv camera and from there to unknown
      place. Just as the post mortom report suggests that robert had consumed
      drugs and his inde was slowly bruning due to the constant ciggeret
      inhaling. They then did inquire robert's classmates and even did nicotine
      test but seems like nothing came out. They did found 5 more students that
      consumed siggerets but doing a drug test isn't that easy. So they did
      tried to drug tests but some parents are too presistent in not letting
      their children do it since even if they consumed drugs it would be shamful
      for them in socity. It took them an entire week to make things out and
      today the resutls should be out. And yes they did had to promice to the
      parents of the students that they will keep the test results out from
      public. Austin tells Sam that he's doing too much compromising. If he does
      that things will be harder. Sam asks what would have Austin done then.
      <br />
      <br />
      Austin said that he would have done the same but insted of being quiet
      about the investigation he would have make sure that no matter what he did
      he wouldn't be questioned since he constantly needs to check on suspects
      inspite of the family reputation. The value of one's life is greater than
      one's reputation. And if Austin did the investigation then he would have
      leagally full control to persue the test. Inspite of the parent's
      interfearence. Sam agrees to Austin and Austin then asks Sam if he has any
      suspects yet but Sam explains that he is still investigating and doesn't
      want to judge anyone right now cause it'll only distract him from the real
      criminal. Austin tells Sam that even if he knows that the guy he suspects
      is no way the killer he should always pick a suspect since if that man
      isn't then he can atleast clear people from suspecion. Sam then tells
      austin that he wishes his assistane in this case which austin tried to
      deny since he retired a long time ago out of the guilt that he never
      managed to catch the killer of Mike. On the other side Jessika is seen
      looking outside of the window of her school. While grey is talking with
      stephine about the stuff going on. Stephine asks what they are goanna do
      next. How long are they goanna keep them locked in school for no reason.
      Grey explains that he wants to go home since school is not going anywhere.
      They never teach anything in school anyways but this week school really
      went bad.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey explains that he feels bad for coming to school since he wasted a
      week of his vecation. The teacher William came in aid to teach. The
      students gathered around to ask any new information about the killer of
      robert. While they do stephine asks grey what he meant when grey told
      stephine what she will think if grey knew the name of the killer. Grey
      said he was just asking a hyphotothical question. He doesn't actually
      knows who he is but grey thinks that there is a chance the guy who killed
      robert is someone grey knows. Stephine asks why grey have such feeling and
      grey doesn't reply and stephine says that it's probapally one of grey's
      secrets. She dosen't want to force grey to tell her everything even though
      she would love to try to understand the situation. Grey smiles and was
      about to say something but Alvin comes and teases grey for getting too
      close to stephine which makes grey uncomfortable. The teacher tells
      everyone to get to their seat since he's goanna take attendence and goanna
      tell something real important after wards. After taking the attendence
      William told everyone a secret that was never told. (flashback)William
      confesses that they had a class teacher who's name was camilio. She was
      real beautiful whom many people like william have fallen for. Among them
      was one of their teacher Kevin.
      <br />
      <br />
      9 years ago when she came to teach in this school they didn't knew much
      about her but turns out she was married. She even had a son. Named Grace.
      William then tells grey to stand up. Grey did without knowing why. He was
      pretty shocked. William then tells the entire class room how due to their
      similerities of not having a parent and grey not having any parents they
      became like brothers. but that day was grace's birthday. Grey went to his
      birthday with gifts but witnessed something horryfying. Grey was shaking.
      William told the entire class that how grey saw the murder of Camilio and
      Grace himself. Grey was horrified. A side of grey no one saw till now.
      Grey told william that he wasn't supposed to tell eveyrone about it just
      yet. It was clear that grey was super angry at william. Willaim explains
      that he needed to tell everyone since grey draws a coonection towards the
      case 7 years ago. He himself sow the mark those psychopaths gave to
      camilio and the police are not asking co operation... Grey left the
      classroom out of anger. Stephine did not knew this fact about grey. Alvin
      went to see grey and asked him not to leave. Grey said he doens't want to
      be a part of any of this. Grey tells them to forget his existence. While
      grey was leaving angryly stephine came in clutch and told grey to stay.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey said he won't sty at this school anymore. He's goanna apply for a
      transfer. Stephine asks why and grey tells her that he doesn't want to
      stay at a place where people around him knows his biggest vaunerability.
      He wants to stay out of all these things. Stephine tells grey that he'll
      just be running away from his problems. Grey says he knows he is running
      away but he wants to kneep running away. Keep believeing that... Never
      mind. Grey leaves. Stephine understands that grey is still hiding
      something. On the other hand william gave the school students a number to
      dial if they are in danger and ali realized that its goanna be pain if
      students like few calls the police for no reason then this number effort
      will backfire. William remembers how things went in the past. Kevin was
      furious. He didn't wanted to marry camilio. He just loved her and wanted
      her to be happy. He can't accept her death. He thinks that he found
      something and is goanna expose a certain someone if possible. But after
      that kevin's death body was found. William never realized who that guy was
      kevin was talking about to expose. Probapally something that camilio told
      him about. Maybe the principal knows something about it but isn't telling
      anyone for a reason. Things are too compliated. What's going on. On the
      other hand some guys tried prank calling the police. It didn't caused much
      but the police were irritated.
      <br />
      <br />
      They knew that they can't just go around hoping this could help since it's
      not clear if it's a prank call or not. Regardless they can't loose their
      temper. While walking home grey is confronted by jessika and jessika asks
      grey if he's really goanna leave over such matter cause the principle
      won't accept transfer over such matter since he's such a cruel guy. Grey
      says that if that what will happen then he'll leave by force. He will stop
      studying and start doing something else then. Jessika explains to grey
      that it's futile since he needs a real passion. Things are never goanna go
      acording to grey's will. Even though grey thinks things will be in grey's
      favoure but it wont. that's reality. Grey asks what she really wants from
      him. She explains that she wants to give grey her number to keep in touch.
      Some touch hurts you know. Grey understood something. Jessika shoerd grey
      one of her scars on her body. Grey undestood that it was a form of alert
      or SOS. They exchange their number and grey tells jessika that she can
      call him for help anytime she wants. Jessika then asks grey when grey is
      goanna leave and grey explains that he isn't. He'll wait a bit like what
      she said. Nothing happens in life acording to one's will. At night grey
      was making food for himself is when stephine rang the door bell. She's
      here to live with him for a few days. Grey welcomes her. The way stephine
      walked in home reminded grey of a certain girl. Grey was shcoked but
      instantly realized that it was a bad memory. After talking a while
      stephine asks grey if he's goanna leave and grey replies no. Stephine
      jokingly says she knew grey won't go that far. She tells grey that grey
      doesn't need to feel burdened and can share everything to her if it helps
      but grey tells her that there is nothing to tell. He already told the
      police everything he could. He never saw the faces of the killer properly.
      His memory is hazy and he couldn't make a proper sketch.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine thought that grey was still hiding something but thought that
      grey had told her what he could. They were eating food is when a door bell
      rang. Grey went to see and it was Austin. It surprised grey. Austin wanted
      to stay at grey's place for a few days since Sam requested Austin to join
      the investigation since he knows more than him. Grey was worried since
      stephine is also living with them and asks stephine if she wishes to leave
      or go home but stephine says she'll be fine and on top of that she's
      curious about the case. She asks austin if she can know about it and it
      creates a suspussion in Austin's mind that this girl may be after the
      invastigation details rather than just curiocity. So austin's first
      suspect is Stephine clay. The daughter of steven the current ceo of the
      company. Micke was the founder but after his death steven became the ceo
      inspite of not being the owner. Austin wonders if Steven is trying to make
      stephine the owner since it means he'll get the entire company after his
      death. Maybe yes since he couldn't got his hands on the company itself but
      it could also be a massive no since steven left stephine's mother a very
      long time ago. It's night time and grey turns on the ac since it's
      probapally goanna be hot once they sleep. Stephine was having wierd ideas.
      They both sleep and nothing special happens. Grey just falls asleap. This
      surprises stephine. She asks grey if he doesn't has any fantacy desires.
      Grey explains that it's not like he doesn't has. It's just that it's not
      like stephine wants to do anything right now. Stephine then asks if grey
      wants to do it or not. Grey asks if she has ever done it and she tells
      grey that she hasn't. Grey then goes as far to tell her not to have any
      physical relationship with anyone since it's bad for her age. She's still
      young and needs to prepare both mentally and physically to figure out what
      will happend due to her desires. She can't just be a kid like other and
      think that it's fun so do it. Ofcourse it will have concequences no matter
      what. Stephine tells grey that he started talking like her father.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey realized something and apologised. He forgot the fact that she was
      his girlfriend and gave her genuien suggestion. Stephine asks him how he
      can forget such thing. Grey explains that he treats people like humen. He
      doesn't treat people too highly or too lowly. Plus it's humen brain. Who
      knows when she'll change her mind and go find someone else. That's why
      grey thought it would be best to give her this suggestion. Stephine was
      surprised how far grey thinks and also annoyed. She asks why grey don't
      want her all for himself. Grey thinks and answers that maybe it's cause
      she's not really his. It's all temporary and grey is not goanna pretend
      like they love eachothe for years. Grey is still adapting into the
      sitaution, her way of thinking and trying to figure out if they will be
      happy after this or it's fuitile to even persue love. Stephine asked grey
      if he loves her or not since it's not what she wanted to hear. Grey tells
      her that he loves her and since he took a form of responcibility then
      he'll do whatever it takes to make her happy. Even as far as to let her
      go. Stephine smiles and asks grey if he's trying to copy any movie to act
      cool or anything. Grey then though and said that he doesn't think his
      words were original since many movies already used such words. But grey
      didn't said those words out of his pureness. He just said that cause he
      doesn't want to feel responcable when stephine leaves. A backup plan.
      Stephine laughs and says she's not goanna leave anytime soon. They both go
      to sleep. Stephine was feeling real good.
      <br />
      <br />
      She never thought she will feel like this again. Someone who wants her and
      cares for her. She like this feeling and wonders why she never tried to
      approach grey before. Was she an idiot. The next day greay wakes up and
      tells stephine to wake up too since they will be late for school. Stephine
      argues with grey since they should have waken much earlier since she
      needed time for make up. Grey tells her to hurry and they leave leaving
      charge of the house to austin. Grey startes at stephine the entire way and
      stephine asks why grey's looking at her like that and grey tells her that
      she's looking beautiful today he doesn't undestand why. Did she use a new
      powder or something. Stephine says she did't. Matter of fact she didn't
      even got the time to make up. Grey asks stephine why she always ruins her
      beatuful face with make up.
      <br />
      <br />
      Is this a common thing for girls. Stephine tells grey that if he likes
      this way of her then she will try to look preety this way. They go to the
      school and eveyone was happy to see grey. After a few minutes the entire
      classroom turned into an interogation room and grey explained to everyone
      that he doesn't remmberts everything properly and also don't want to.
      William enters the room and appreacitases grey's co opearation. Grey tells
      william that he still doesn't forgive william to suddenly reveal such
      secret of grey so openly. William told grey that he's willing to give grey
      a party if he wants and eveyone wants to go there. Grey asks why such
      thing and william explains that they will soon have a farewell ceremoy for
      the students that will leave this school. They are at their final year
      afterall. Maybe they can insted have a smaller party. veryone rejects the
      idea and they will have a big farewell party even if everyone in the
      school suddenly drops dead. William says then there won't be any party.
      Ali goes ahead then to suggest that they will party at ali's place again
      but insted of being a gurage it'll be in the school. Originally ali was
      planning to do a small celebration for his birthday with selected few
      friends but insted they can do a big party with all their friends and
      classmates in the school. They can do it in fryday when the school will be
      closed and they can get permission from the gate keeper to get the keys
      for a room. Everyone agrees and the date is decided. Grey- "Sorry Robert.
      Seems like no one cares for your death."

      Grey looks at jessika and she leaves. Stephine was talking to aria and
      grey decided to leave and meet up with her. They both talk while walking.
      Grey asks what she wants since grey doesn't know what to do. Jessika tells
      grey to break up with stephine and date her. Grey asks why and jessika
      doens't want to tell but jessika explains. Jessika explains to grey that
      she's having a mental break down and doesn't knows when she'll die. She'll
      need to pretend normal for now but two things are not right. Her mental
      psycho and her physical condition. That's why she wants to have a private
      chat with grey on bed. Grey tells her to wait for his messege and grey
      promices her that no one will hurt her again. The day passes and grey
      thinks what jessika ment by her words. Is she being abused by two people.
      That sounded like it. Who are those two people. Are they by any chance her
      parents. Why is not telling anybody about the abuse? Cause they are her
      parents? Or she feels responsible for someone's death. Or she killed
      someone herself. That's probapally it. So one of them are a psychpath. She
      is clrealy in danger. Is she also getting physically harrased? That's
      something he'll need to figure out by time. On the other side Jessika is
      seen being abused by two people. One of them that looks like the boss
      tortures her and tells her to poison stephine using a bottle. Jessika says
      she'll do it but begs for her life.
      <br />
      <br />
      The boss looking guy tells her that they'll let her go once they are
      satisfied and started harrasing jessika. They also add up that if she
      survibes and thinks that she can't take it anymore then she can
      killherself using the poison. The next day comes and stephine is going to
      school and grey is not going to. Insted he messeged jessika to come to his
      place since stephine is not home. Stephine asks why she'll need to go to
      school alone and grey explains that she needs to since there is something
      important that came up that grey can't tell her right now. Grey believes
      that stephine will try to understand since it could determine someone's
      life. Stephine tells grey to stop joking but grey tells stephine that he's
      100% person serious and if nothing is done jessika might kill herself.
      Stehine goes to school alone. On the other side jessika was crying for her
      situation but after getting her messege she wanted to leave that place
      after wearing her cloths and called her mother saying she stayed at a
      friends house and now she can't go to school cauase she has a fever. She's
      coming home. Akio stopped her. Jessika ended the call but akio took it and
      heard everything. Seems like she wasnt lying and told jessika to keep such
      act and gives her a lot of money. Then he tells her that as long as she
      keeps her promice to not to tell anyone they will also keep their silence
      how she was the one who helped them to get rid of kevin. In return they'll
      give her money and pleasure as much as she wants. The messege comes.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey's messege. Akio sees it and laughs and tells jessika to go and
      satisfy another guy since it'll only help them to get rid of suspecion.
      Akio then tells her that they won't give her a mark as intended. Jessika
      understandhing the situation goes to grey's house and then to the bedroom.
      austin left this morning. Jessika starts undressing and grey tells her
      that they don't need to go that far. On the other side stephine sees that
      jessika didn't came to school and wondered what's even going on.
      (flashback)everything started when she was very young. three men came to
      meet Jessika. She was frightend. They wanted to know about camilio and
      grace. She was given money for it. She doesn't remembers if she willingly
      took it or was scared but she accepted the job. She spied on them and told
      everything to those people. They later killed camilio and grace. Her only
      son. Later she found out they are the same people who killed griffin mick.
      She was frightend. Not knowing what to do she stayed quiet since she was
      scared. They approached her again and gave various jobs to her like
      providing someone with lunch box or supplying drugs. She was told that if
      she ever tells anybody about it she'll be killed by them. And even if they
      don't manage to do it they will be constantly at it while the police puts
      her in jail and she'll be sentenced to death. Back then she was super
      frightened and didn't undestand what was about to happen but she had done
      something unforgivable. Their teacher kevin was going carzy over Camilio's
      death since they fell in love with her. But even after 2 years of her
      death he continued to persue her killer. This time she was given the job
      to kill kevin. So she did. She killed him by suffocating him into water.
      <br />
      <br />
      Later those psychopaths gave him a mark on his back. They were talking
      about giving jessika a mark too in case she tells anybody about her body
      but they didn't since grey messeged her in the right moment and they are
      now planning to give grey all the blame for her physical harrashment. Grey
      understands the situation and asks her what she wants to do. She kisses
      grey which was unexpected and told grey that she wishes grey to sty by her
      side. She can't do anything since she's on tight spot. She want someone to
      love as a mental support until they actually leave her. Grey explains to
      jessika that it's not possible since grey is already in a relation with
      stephine. Jessika insists that they can always break up. Grey then got out
      of the position and told jessika that she didn't revealed her entire truth
      just to say don't do anything about it. She wants to get out of the
      situation and always wanted to tell someone about it. Jessika accepts that
      and starts crying. She tells grey that the name of the killer is akio
      kimura. Jessika tells grey that she is taken the job to poison stephine.
      Grey asks why they wants to poison stephine and jessika explains that they
      are doing it for fun. They seem to have some short of resentment towards
      stephine's father. Grey asked where she has the poison and jessika shows
      the poison. Grey smells the poison and can't tell if it's expired wine or
      something.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey takes a bit on hand and doesn't understands anything. Grey tells her
      to keep that in her pocket. Jessika was shocked. She asked grey if he's
      not goanna stop her. Grey says that he doesn't knows what to do. He asks
      if jessika is hungrey and takes off his shirt and goes out to get some
      food. He looks out of the window and as expected someone was there. He
      left. Grey put his shirt into a basket but for some reason it was wet.
      Grey wondered what to do since the situation was tricky. A slight mistake
      could lead to loosing everything adding another layer of
      missunderstanding. Jessika started eating and grey thought what to do and
      remembered when he saw the murder of a young girl. His body starts
      shivering. He notes that he will never let a similer event happen again in
      his life. The day of ali's birthday comes. Everyone is happy to wish him
      happy birthday. Everyone was there including jessika. William was also
      invited as the home class room teacher. They seem to be having a good time
      but no one likes how there isn't any music. Grey gives ali a cake as a
      form of gift. Stephine and grey made real hard time to make it. Stephine
      remembers how it went while making the cake. Ali took the cake and placed
      it in a safe place. Stephine was only looking at jessika and started
      talking to her. She certainly looked depressed. Stephine asked her if she
      need anything and tried talking to her. They didn't talk much and stephine
      returned. They were having fun. Stephine asked grey about his friends
      since she
      <br />
      <br />
      wants to know more about grey. Grey tells that ali is a reliable friend
      grey met 6 years ago. Alvin is a old friend grey knew 11 Years since. And
      griffin is someone grey knew since his birth. Both of their mothers were
      good friends. They almost got the same name but didn't. They knew
      eachother since borth and became friends but due time they found
      themselves having resentment towards eachother. That's why grey doesn't
      talks much to griffin. Stephine calls grey introvert for not expressing
      his feelings and grey says that he certainly has some short of
      introverticy but not entirely. It's mostly due to hasitance and
      overthinking. Grey used to spill everything that came to mind but people
      started calling him a lier and got offended by his actions that frightens
      grey. A place where no one likes him and he's blammed for something he
      didn't do or something that happend due to a mistake or missunderstanding.
      That's the most painful experience. Grey doesn't likes hurtin someone else
      by his words Unless they really piss him off. After the party was going
      smoothly they decided to cut the cake since it's getting late. Austin was
      there so they had enough protection. After cutting the cake they all had
      drinks. Grey purposefully told ali to add ruafza insted of the normal
      syrup since it's red. After everyone had their fair share of drink grey
      dranks his glass and even stephine. Jessika was worried about something
      since grey told her to put the poison into one of the glasses. He himself
      took care of the thing.
      <br />
      <br />
      It's upto him who got the poison glass. Something crazy then happend.
      Someone sudenly got drunk among the croud. It was none other than
      stephine. She started babbeling wierd stuff to grey like do you love me or
      her anger towards alvin and slipped and fell and she feels real tired.
      Austin saw her and asked who brought alchahol to this party and everyone
      was shocked. They didn't knew what happend. William also inquired everyone
      about who did this joke. Austin said that he will overlook this event
      since it's probapally a prank but if someone does the same again then
      austin will himself find that guy and put him into jail. Nobody was hurt.
      Grey took stephine to home. Jessika was confused. So stephine drank the
      poison but it wasn't poison. It was alchahol. Jessika went to akio kimura
      and he praised her for acomplishing the job since it was just a test for
      her to see if she has the will power to kill someone and she does. She
      didn't got soft after all these years. Akio wanted to know if she was
      strong enough to do it or kill herself since she was given the poison.
      Jessika wanted to drink it herself at one point but thankfully didn't.
      Akio then tells jessika to kill stephine now for real. How is upto
      jessika. If she acomplishes it then akio will let jessika go. Other
      wise... The next day stephine wakes up and asks what happend and grey
      tells stephine that as they thought stephine was tried to be pranked.
      Someone put alchahol at her drink and she started babbeling about how much
      she likes grey and the topic goes off topic. grey goes to school and asks
      jessika what she's thinking.
      <br />
      <br />
      Jessika said grey to forget what she told him about. Grey asks why and
      jessika told grey that she finally got a chance to get out of this mess.
      Grey asks if she's really goanna kill stephine. It surprises jessika and
      she asks grey how he knows it and grey tells her that they tested a small
      portion of the poison grey took on his hands. They figured out it was just
      expired wine. It did great deal to stephine's stomach but didn't killed
      her. It's obious that it was just a test to see what she's capable of or
      something similer short. She came here talking about a chance of her
      freedome which means they had a deal. What could it be other than
      stephine's death. Jessika asks what grey thinks they want. Grey tells her
      that they probapally want stephine's father to come to see her when she
      dies and then kidnap him or something. Or maybe someone requested to
      kidnap stephine as a supply since they are the short of people who does
      humen trafficking. Jessiak asks if grey is going to report her and grey
      tells her that he won't. Grey explains that he had no intention to
      inerfear or act tough. He's not capable of saving someone but since
      jessika entruested her with her feeling grey won't tell a soul.

    <h2>Arc 5- William</h2>
    <img src="Images/william.webp" class="william" alt="william" />
    <p>
      The police were running out of clues and Austin suggested to keep an eye
      on william since he's supecious in austin's eyes. Austin remembers that he
      asked grey who is the most suspecious person in grey's eyes. Grey said
      william and when asked why grey explains that william is actually dating a
      girl who's 17. Techinically a minor but maybe he's the only one that
      noticed it. Stephine was curious about what was happening with everything
      and grey told stephine to keep an eye on william if she thinks it'll help.
      She was spying on william and saw a girl. She usually goes to study with
      willam. Quite suspecious to think since she's basically dating her class
      teacher. It's Kale. She tells William that she'll not be able to go to
      study with william since her grand parents came home. William says that
      it's not a problem. Kale left but william saw someone walking. Stephine
      wanted to leave but seems like she made enough noice. William was going
      there to see who was standing there but grey went to clutch and took
      stephine out of that place and william asks grey what they were doing
      there and grey asks if william really wants to hear.
      <br />
      <br />
      WIlliam doesn't want to and let's them go. Stephine thanks grey for saving
      her. Grey tells her not to act hastly since they are playing with fire.
      Stephine asks grey why he thinks willaim may have something to do with the
      deaths. Grey explains that when grey was child he got a birthday
      invitation. He went to the party and saw the deadbody of people and
      quickly ran out of the house and william was the nearest person. Willaim
      was near the house. If they take into account that william's house is out
      of the city and he specifiqly was near the house. On top of that he had a
      massive crush on camilio. It's possible that he killed her after
      realizeing she was married. Stephine wanted to build a operation to
      investigate william and grey told stephine that they are just some kids.
      They can't do something so serious. Stephine says that the person who's
      tryed to poison stephine could kill her now for sure. Grey tells stephine
      that as long as he's with her no one can even touch her hair. Maybe they
      can if they really try but they won't get away with it in the end.
      Stephine really wants to do it since william is super sus. And grey
      decided to build a team around it with alvin and her. Consisting those
      three since adding more people will be bad and the secret will be
      revealed.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine didn't wanted to join forces with arvin and arvin didn't the same
      way. Both of them didn't liked eachother. Grey told stephine that they are
      all friends here. Maybe they have personal resentment towards eachother
      but does it really matter since they are not in a reltaion or anything.
      Stephine was curious how he's letting her stay with her ex. Grey told
      stephine that he's not letting them live but having a bad relation with
      other people specially friends is harmful for one's own good. Arvin told
      grey that he has no resentment towards grey but he doesn't likes this gold
      digger stephine. They started arguing and grey told both of them that
      those two are getting bored of normal life and now they want to spy on
      their teacher to create a fun event. That's not something you should do
      Arvin got annoyed and told grey that he's saying it constantly to make
      sure they don't go out of their way forgetting that it's only just out of
      curiocity but arvin tells grey that they also want to be part of some
      short of investigation and want to solve cases. Grey tells arvin to grow
      up and let the adults hanel things that are conncted to this and just do
      it as a fun little game and arvin tells greay that he's not goanna listen
      to him since he wants thrill and fun. Grey smiles and tells him to stay
      careful at least. Arvin the laughs about how he never thought that one of
      the students dated their class teacher and started laughing.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey tells arvin to stay quiet about it. Kale left and arvin asks what
      they sould do and grey told arvin to keep an eye on her since she will be
      their golden goose. They do and stephine went ahead to talk to kale. Arvin
      asks if it was a good idea and grey asked arvin what was he planning to
      do. watch some randome npc girl return home. Arvin- "Ya." Grey told arvin
      that they can't wait for the right moment. They need to set things up.
      Stephine talked to kale and they reached a point where stephine commented
      about her hair pin and someone special gave it to her. Grey realized
      something. Stephine talked more and she revealed about a resturant out of
      slip and tried to take it back and when asked to meet somewhere near to
      drink something she tried to back it down. She went home. She went home.
      The operation was done. Seems like they found nothing and arvin talked to
      stephine about the hair pin. DId willaim gave it to her. Grey thought for
      a while and had no responce. He said he's going somewhere and told arvin
      and stephine to go home and due to force they had to. Grey then went to
      the resturant that was slipped from kale's moute. Grey though if something
      was special about this place so he decide to order a casual thing from the
      menu and didn't found anything suspecious.
      <br />
      <br />
      HE was using his phone for 2 hours and eating food. During that time
      someone came to take a parcel and their way of talking intrested grey. He
      looked at the clock and left the resturant. He went to a near by place
      with cctv. He using his connection with austin saw everything he needed
      to. He then found himself into a back door of a certain place that he
      managed to sneak in and then got out just after having a peak. He left a
      certain something there. The next day stephine met with kale again and
      they decided to go eat somewhere finally and stephine is told by grey to
      visit that one place specifiqly which surprises kale but she decided to go
      there anyways. There at exact 12 pm a guy comes for a specifiq parcel. It
      was a different person. Stephine talked for a hour with kale. They left.
      They seem to have became the best of friends. The next day grey tells
      stephine to take aria with her where ever she's going. Stephine seem to
      have forgotten about their secret mission which is good anyways. Arvin
      remembers it and tells grey that he's dissopointed at himself since he
      didn't knew what it took to continue investigation. He thought he could
      have became a good detective. A week passes from the original day of the
      operation that is forgotten by arvin and stephine since she's busy going
      out with her friends. Arvin tells grey about his dissopintment in himself
      since he couldn't think of anything. Nothing was coming to mind other than
      stalking but it was useles.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey told arvin to go home and have a nice lunch cause he may need it.
      Grey told Austin that he needs that one perticuler guy to go and and buy
      some specifiq food from a specifiq location and austin asked grey what he
      needs him for and grey explains that he can't feed his girlfriend home
      made nothing always. Austin didn't questioned. Stephine was delighted by
      grey's act and wanted to know what they should do next but grey explains
      that he needs to be somewhere and asks stephine to take care of the house.
      Stephine doesn't want to but grey tells her that he needs someone to take
      care of his cat and stephine was forsed to obey. Fun fact, grey owns a cat
      and a dog. Dog alwasy stays outside and cat always inside. Stephine bring
      both of them inside to play with. Grey calls leaves home and after coming
      near a certain location he calls the person holding food and pretends that
      he came near for work and wants to take the food himself if he can meet
      him. The person who just bought food agrees and tells grey that he's
      waiting in the location. Grey intentionally goes to a different (It's not
      the same hotel kale menthoned) hotel and tells them that he's after a
      parcel a guy came ordered in and uses a secret code. There was a wierd guy
      who asked grey if he's new. Grey explained that he isn't. He came here
      himself since he was near the place. Grey gives the person extra money as
      tip since he's in hurry. Grey returned to the place where the person was
      standing and grey asked him what he was doing there and grey explained
      then that they must have had a missunderstanding since he went to a
      different hotel.
      <br />
      <br />
      The guy asked if he's goanna return food and grey says he will and so grey
      goes back and returns the food and the guy who took the food back checked
      the food if anything was wrong and nothing was wrong. Grey returned and
      told the guy beside him that he can go now. Grey then called austin and
      told him something and explained something great. The next morning william
      was absent. The students wonderd what made william late but no one cared
      since it only means they can get leave time but they are worried about
      their attendence. Grey asked kale to be somewhere at the tiffin prieod.
      Today william didn't came to school. Grey told kale that they've been
      following kale for a few days. Kale was shocked. Grey then told kale that
      he went to a certain resturant to eat and found out something wierd. The
      students started panicing in the class room. They found out that william
      was caught by the police for illigal drug use and possibly missbehaving
      with a school girl. On this side grey asks kale if she's hurt or anything.
      Of course she isn't. She's been taking drugs and secretly got into a
      relations with william to make sure he doesn't tells anybody. Willaim
      didn't wanted to do it but she insisted to willaim keeping his moute shut
      since he found out her secret. Willaim rejected her proposal but kept
      silent since he didn't wanted to create a hvoc with the family of kales.
      Seems like kale's father had a good amount of influence in williams life.
      He can change william's posting in a snap. Too money money having it's
      hard to focous on your own daughter that she started taking drugs.
      <br />
      <br />
      Kale wanted grey to shut. Grey didn't and told kale more that he went to
      see the matter himself and found out that there are people in that hotel
      that sound suspecious cause grey heard many rumors about that hotel being
      bad and knew what kind of people go there. The moment grey heard kale
      going ther with a certain someone grey knew that this certain someone has
      to be the one who helped her to get this bad influence. On further
      influence grey found out it was one of her father's men. Today they raided
      the entire area and caught several people. Among them were her father's
      men. William is caught for not revelaing her truth. And this boyfriend of
      kale's is that one guy of her father's men. Grey told kale to speak up if
      she has to say anything about herself. Kale doesn't want to and accepts
      everything and theretens grey saying that if grey tells anybody about this
      her father will take care of him. Grey tells her that her father won't do
      anything since he's already too ashamed of himself for his own men. He
      can't protect his position since he knows that if his own name comes out
      due to this even then he may not have his job anymore. Grey tells kale to
      speak the truth and surrender to the police. Keeping lies or anything will
      only worsen her position. She has a bright future. She can get out of this
      drug use and leave it and start living a real life.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey promices kale that he won't tell anybody as long as she promices to
      keep her end of the promice. She will tell grey everything and in return
      no one will speak a word about her. Grey explains that if she doesn't then
      she'll have to go to jail for her deeds and it could ruine her reputation
      and only thing that'll come out of it is her life runing. Grey tells kale
      not to do it and speak up. Kale then tells grey everything. It's her
      confesstion. Kale started confessing that she got into all this cause of
      that guy as grey menthoned and she never wanted to but she had to for his
      influence. She blammed william that she never had anything with william.
      It was a lie that she told william anything. Matter of fact she never told
      willaim to do anything. William himself forgave her and told her to persue
      a better path. Grey explains that she should not lie since william is not
      a scum who'll do whatever she desires. She definetely theretend him or
      atleast so. Kale insists on saying that she didn't. And it was william who
      started creepin on her. Grey asked her why she continued studying on his
      house then. She explained that it's to get good grades. she was forsed
      too. She was actually planning on stooping. Grey asked her who akio kimura
      was. She never heard of that name in her entire life. Grey told her that
      if she's lying then grey woul have nithing in his hands for saving her.
      She instantly backed down and said that a guy could know him. Grey told
      her that he doesn't want to hear small stuff. He wants to learn every
      detail she knows cause there is a guy who's trying to kill stephine and
      grey can't take chances a bit even it means to go the farthest possible.
      Even though grey has no intentin to get involbed he's trying to stay out
      of this as much as possible.
      <br />
      <br />
      It was very hard for him to convince the police to spare kale but if she
      doesn't then grey would have no choice. Kale tells grey that he doesn't
      need to tell her anything anymore. She'll reveal everything. Kale explains
      that a few months ago when she was getting bored she went outside with her
      friends and a guy started rizzing her up. He was her current boyfriend.
      They got close and he even took her to some places and there she started
      taking drugs. She usualy was told to use a special code to get drugs when
      he's not with her but she always tells the guy working to just give her
      the usual. She doesn't when the guy is not in work or someone else is in
      work. Grey said that that's the reason it took a week for grey to figure
      out that they had the password. But to confrim it he kept looking throw
      and then when he heard her use the same password for 2 times straight.
      Kale explains that during her time spend with her bf she met many guys
      that worked there involbed into shady stuff. She even saw a guy with gun.
      After a few weeks she was caught by william and she started harassing him
      to make sure she doesn't does anything and then william told kale that she
      should stop it and he left. Kale didn't knew and was scared for a whole
      week and then figured out that it's for her father. But she knew better
      than anyone not to play with fire so she started acting too good to
      william and william saw her drug use as a bad havit.
      <br />
      <br />
      Kale even pretended not to consume those anymore and even convinced
      william. Grey feels bad for william since that guy had nothing to do with
      all this and yet he was suffering for... Kale explained that she thought
      stephine was just a normal person who started talking to her just like her
      bf but she won't forgive them. Grey explains that he doesn't cares if she
      kills grey but grey doesn't want stephine's smile to be gone. Grey was
      shocked by his own speech since he thought he proirotized his life more
      than someone else's life. Then he thought. No. Her smile is worth it. It's
      worth everything. Maybe his own life. He needs to be serious now. Grey
      let's kale go and takes her number and everything in case. And turns
      something off from his phone. Probapally a recorder. The police was at the
      school investigating and students were getting captured based on illigal
      use of drugs. In a single day the police arrested 103 people. 46 of them
      were students. There were also 21 suspects. The police were having a hard
      time figuring out things since they caught too many people. Grey was at
      the police station and sam didn't expected this when Austin said they are
      goanna wait another week even though they got the results for the drug
      test. Grey asked sam if the resutls were 100% accurate.
      <br />
      <br />
      Sam was a bit shocked to see grey at first but he told grey that the
      results were not wrong but it seems like many skipped the test. Grey asked
      if a certain names were present and they were. Grey said that he would
      like to meet one of them and sam asked why and grey said that they may
      have something grey might need to know. Austin asked if grey wants to be
      directly part of this investigation. Grey said that he can regardless of
      their openion since he already helped to catch around 100 people. It's not
      like he's going to be paid for anything but there is something that grey
      thinks he may have the power to do. Since he can't laze around. Sam thinks
      he can get his first case closed soon. He's happy for it.

    <h2>Arc 6- Jessika</h2>
    <p>
      <br />
      <br />
      Jessika goes to a place cause she was told to go there and there she meets
      that one guy she served under for so many years and both of them started
      tourchuring her and telling her that her life is worthless and solceded
      her for giving out their information and jessika explained that he told
      nobody nothing. And they realized that grey must be the guy she told
      everything to. Jessika insiststs saying that she never told anything to
      him. She never got the chance to. Both of them believe her but inspite of
      that they plan to sell her off since this grey guy figured their plans and
      that must mean that her existence is their downfall. Grey met the guy he
      wanted to meet. Grey asked him if he knows who akio kimura is. That guy
      said he doesn't knows him or ever heard of his name anyways. But he knows
      one guy that may know his name. Since he knows everyone. Grey then asked
      him where he got gun from. That guy denies that fact. Grey says that he
      has information that he bought guns. He doesn't cares if he still has it
      or not but he does want to know where he bought it from. Grey wants to
      know everything he has to offer.
      <br />
      <br />
      Otherwise he isn't getting out. That guy explains that his friends brough
      him to that place and that's when during their gang membership they got
      their guns and other stuff. Grey tells that guy to tell grey a story of
      his life. It certainly would be cool since it's gang reltated stuff. That
      guy started explaining that his friends wanted to rule the classroom and
      other stuff so they created a gang and then while they tried to control
      the class another grup from day shif came to chalenge them. They lost and
      then decided to took a different path. They decided to insted buy guns and
      they became instantly a great deal but the other group bought guns too.
      But they can't use their guns on open so they don't use it. The only use
      they had was to frighten the other one. But it's not like they won't bring
      it when they need it. That's why they kept it with them in the school in a
      secret compartment. They take theirportion of consuption by directly
      meeting the guy who supplies them. The person in charge of everything is
      mori. There are other people too. That guy then tells grey other names.
      Grey then asks if that was it. That guy explains that he has life story
      but they are not related to his work or addiction or this guy grey wants
      to know about. Grey asks his family status and he says that his family has
      nothing to do with anything. Grey tells him that his parents failed to
      raise him. That guy then tells grey that how will he even understand when
      he's parentless. Grey tells him that at least he managed to raise himself
      well.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey left. Austin asks grey who akio kimura is and grey explains that he's
      probapally the untimate person they are after. Grey let's austin hear both
      recordings grey made. Austin got the grasp of the situation and told grey
      that he may not have made the best of decissions but he did what he
      thought was best and that's good. Grey explains that jessika needs to be
      saved but ausin wonderes if there is any way for her to be saved since she
      killed someone at the age of 12. Grey told austin that they don't need to
      decide what happens after she is saved since she won't be sentenced to
      death or atleast that's what he hopes. They need to think something.
      Austin asks if grey has any ideas. Grey wants to ask those names to
      jessika to hear her responce. Anything after that is something he needs to
      hold. Sam asks why not call her right now and both austin and grey looks
      at him with a wierd eye. Austin told sam that they are not only planning
      to save her but rather catch those guys behind her. They can't catch them
      if they suddenly gave her shelter. Austin says that they need to bait
      them. Austin explains that he was planning to use grey to talk to that
      guy. Grey suggests that he has nothing to do with there being since he
      isn't an officer or so. Austin tells grey that they are goanan have to use
      him since he is the only one who can ask good questions or so.
      <br />
      <br />
      Austin also implies that grey can interogate well. Sam says that relying
      on a child won't be so good. Austin tells sam that he's 18 already. Just a
      month more to go. And besides he was the one who brought the information
      at the first hand. Sam can't argue with that. Grey asks austin how he'll
      even manage to convince him to give out information. Austin say that it
      could be money. Grey tells austin that if they go hasting around to meet
      that guy then even if he agreed to step aside for money everyone else will
      notice him and know something is up. That's not happening. Austin says
      that they only have this lead and don't have any other plan. Grey thinks
      for a few minute and answers that it would be surprisingly tough to come
      back alive if he went. Austin said that they are police and grey has the
      only option to go there as robert's friend maybe. That's why he's the
      perfect canditate. Grey agrees to go and decided what to ask. Grey left
      and sam asks why they just told grey what to asks. Austin said that let
      the boy do it. Since if they told him everything then there is a chance he
      won't come up with anything. Even though his thoughts are avarage, just
      thinking that you can think something interesting allows you to get
      creative. Even if you have the stupidest brain ever.
      <br />
      <br />
      It's a psychological thing which doesn't has it's gurentee but helps you
      sometimese. The day ends and on a different part of the world jessika is
      missing and her parents are consern about her dissepearence. On this side
      Jessika was with akio's ghouns and they were torturing her asking if she
      leaked anything at all and she denied which was part true but they locked
      her up anyways. They said that she is wrotten expirded now. She can be
      thrown away for good now. The last amount of use they can get for her. On
      the other side it was dead of night and grey was walking to a unknown
      street and went to a specifiq location to meet up with a guy and even met
      him after passing throw 3 guy. He wanted to talk to him in private and
      grey expected this information guy to be a gangstar but he was actually a
      servant type guy and grey asked where he can learn about akio and he
      himself tells grey abhout akio and his passion for illigal activities. He
      told eferything about akio as a villain and even that they are having a
      humen traficing a few days later. He even tells grey that they are adding
      a new highschool girl who's name is jessika which surprises grey and he
      asked him why they added her and he explained that she was added cause she
      betrayed them or some short. Grey thought that he made a big mistake
      thinking they were resonable. Then grey thought that he was absulutely
      wrong thinking that it's even possible for her to be safe.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey thought that since she survibed this all till now grey thought she
      could survibe it more. It was not cuase she has will power. It was cause
      those people didn't do anything life theretening to her but seems like
      they are having suspecions over her even though she never told grey
      anything but the stuff they found out. Grey asks everything else regarding
      the situation and asks what that person will do from now and he explains
      that he'll sell more information. Grey gives that guy a bundel of money
      and leaves. It's in millions. That guy leaves but after a few hours when
      he was leaving he got caught by none other than akio kimura. The guy in
      charge of everything. He asked whom he sold information to and what info
      and he told everything to akio and his right hand man asked him what to do
      with them and akio said that they are goanna dissband the sector anyways.
      Akio had enough of such buisness. He only likes killing and he has enough
      money to live a life time. Matter of fact he's planning to leave the
      country a few months later and shif his work to a different location so he
      can earn more money since it's boring in this country. He isn't getting
      any improvement in money incum. It's not fun anymore. Akios kills that guy
      off and told his right hand man to just leave him off and the police can
      find that the person they got intel from died.
      <br />
      <br />
      It's a sign that they have a brand. They create a mark on his back with
      knife and akio said that no one steals his brand. On the other side a
      group is seen transporting some short of caze with people in it. There are
      men too. They are talking how the females are goanna be sold for body work
      and the male are goanna be sold for humen labor until they can and if they
      refuse they'll sell his kidny. Heart and everything including their
      testicles. Same for the females but they have to hurry. The two guys who
      were trying to do something for one last time with jessika threw her naked
      in the caze and told others to send her to the caze where they sell organs
      and there were quite some people there including a few man. They are
      supposed to supply them throw ship cargo. They pack things up and are
      ready to sail but the ship isn't sailing. Something is wrong so a ghoun
      goes to check and doesn't returns. A few minutes pass by and they hear a
      big noise. It's gun shot. The guys got off the ship and tried to escape
      with road since they figured out that they are being caught by the police.
      The two guys tried to call their boss and they weren't picking the call.
      The first person tried using a bike to escape from the police and succeded
      but the second guy went and tried to open the containers and there were
      police who freed the people but they police were in numbers so they got
      shot in and the person tried to take a person in and escape and while
      every other person was trying to escape jessika was there and snatched
      some cloths.
      <br />
      <br />
      She saw a girl who needed help cause she couldn't walk. She helped her and
      got quite close to her and then found herself in a situation where she
      needed to leave her out and flee for her life cause those people were
      approching her throw the same path way. Jessika felt guilty cause she
      couldn't save her but more over killed her. She can never get out of this
      guilt and then found herself in a situation where the guy hel her hostage
      and she didn't wanted to die and wanted to get free but seems like the
      police can't shoot. She wondered what to do since she never wanted to live
      this life. She wanted to live a normal life with her friend hanging
      always. But this thing that has been happening with her. This hell. At
      first she was blammed for killing someone. They then started giving her
      tasks like get money from father for drugs that they fed her and she got
      preety much addicted and a few years ago they started physically doing
      things to her. She wants to live. But not with this past. She rather want
      to die than live at this point. But came for the save. That one guy who
      tortured her for years got shot on the hand for holding the gun. Austin
      told sam to let that guy go which surprises him and sam does. That guy
      thought he had a golden oppurchuinity but austin shot that guy in the
      private part. Austin said that he missed the gun shot. There is too much
      gun shot going on in this place anyways. Unfortunaltely that guy lived and
      austin and sam were sucessful in cathing guys who were included in this
      stuff and they managed to save people.
      <br />
      <br />
      Jessika was saved. She got to go home and her family was surprisingly
      happy to see her which made her question if they even know the full course
      of what happend. ON the other side sam and austin questions that guy about
      akio's existence and he explains that he's planning to leave the country
      in a few days but doesn't know when or for why. Austin assums that he may
      come back for his men or his stuff and told austin to take care cause
      he'll come back and austin asked who brought this guy cause even they
      themselves know that he isn't coming back. The next day something
      surprisingly happend. Grey got his name and photo in the cover page in
      news which made he himself question about the media and how they manage to
      get such informations. Acording to the news a guy named grey found his
      friend in truble so he went and did a lot of stuff and found his school
      teacher having a relation with a student and some drug dealer. At last he
      gave the police the last bit of help to save jessika. Truely a hero but
      grey disagrees with the news cause he did nothing. Matter of fact he was
      just a short of help. Seems like they took grey's social media photo.
      William who was bailed saw the news and didn't knew how to show his face
      to the public. Austin and sam got questioned about the operation method
      and sam explained that he asked austin for help since he has more
      experience and all everything. Austin explains that the media is not
      completely wrong. They did use the help of a school student but they
      didn't depended on that entirely.
      <br />
      <br />
      They made their fair share of information. Matter of fact they knew about
      the existence of a drug house near the place but didn't knew where it was.
      Matter of fact a few other people knew about it's existence but no one
      spoke a word cause they don't want to be at the bad side of some short of
      nation wide criminal. And the fact about the girl who got saved. They have
      nothing to say about it. He in fact informed them about it but they were
      the ones who send him. The higher up guy asked why is grey getting the
      fame and not the police department. Austin says that the reason for that
      is that there is some quality of truth in the information and the higher
      up guy got angry and told austin that now a days every day at least two or
      three people get either killed or dies. Maybe a politician get's arrested
      but people are now a days so used to this stuff that the police don't get
      enough credit for it. Thats why people comitt crime so freeely even though
      half of the time police are the ones who spend their swet in catching this
      guys. Sam is receiveing penelty for letting such even happening. That's
      that he will be removed from this operation along with austin. Austin
      tried to question about it but he was told that he regined from being a
      officer a long time ago. He should have no authority to join it unless
      absulutely no one can solve this case without him. he then asked if they
      recorded everything to the report and austin said he did.
      <br />
      <br />
      Both of them had to leave. While austin was leaving sam told austin thanks
      for helping him this much and apologised for his mistakes and austin
      didn't took sam up to heart. On the other side the guy who fleed from the
      all out war met akio. He asked him for shleter since he came from a long
      distance to hide. Akio asked why he came to him and he explained that the
      entire crew got caught and gun fire and everything. Akio then asked him
      who is goanna take care of the deal that got broken. That guy explains to
      akio that he has no choise but to take it upto himself but in return he
      asks akio for shelter. Akio asks him what made him think that akio will
      clean his mess. Akio kills that guy and leaves a mark behind. He told him
      that he tried to steal his mark by killling a randome school kid named
      robert but no one does it as he does. He reads the news paper and sees
      grey's name behind it and call someone and tells him to do something for
      him. On the other side grey is seen as a hero amon his classmates and even
      stephine. She realizes what he ment when he said that jessika is in a life
      or death in situation. Stephine thought that even though she didn't
      believed on him she tried to compromice. She feels free and great after
      now knowing that it wasn't a excuse. In the class grey is treated like a
      hero. But in that time william came to the class shocking everyone and
      along with him was the principal. Kale was there shocked and the principal
      asked grey to come in front of the class and say something if he has
      anything against william.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey does so as told and goes in front of the class and told everyone that
      not to believe anything they hear from outside or even at the news paper
      cause they contain some miss infomration for them to sell their brand.
      William did nothing wrong. He did got peneltenized for forgiving a certain
      someone thinking that that person may prosper learning their mistake. He
      never did those short of thing or anything related. Even the news may
      label grey as someone who did something heroic but that's not true at all.
      Grey did nothing. It's just austin who is acutally someone grye calls
      uncle who works in the case and grey got curious so he asked austin to
      tell him what he was doing. During the process grey ran some small errends
      for austin and he got all the crdit cause it sounds heroic. Grey explains
      one last time that he has done nothing and he's getting fame for nothing
      and william is getting missfame for something he didn't do. Those are just
      rumors. Just like how william used to teach in this school he will further
      continue teaching as usual. Just cause of some rumors the studenst should
      not look down on their forgiving teacher. Matter of fact it's better to be
      like him who can stand proudly saying that he tried to forgive. The whole
      class starte clapping and william thanked grey for saying what was needed.
      Grey then thought about what happend. Stephine stil killed their own home
      room class teacher so she needs to answer to her sins. She was taken to
      court and then sentenced to jail for 3 years for killing her class teacher
      but none of this information will be made public.
      <br />
      <br />
      The police are expected to keep their secrecy. Grey was present there. He
      then got stood in the court and the layer against him accused grey of
      doing things without permission and trying to play hero. Austin backed
      this up saying that he was the who allowed grey to co operate with them
      cause they thought grey would be a good help. It's all upto the social
      media who took grey into too much account while writing the news. They can
      verify this. Grey is then sentenced innocent but grye has a question. He
      asked who even blammed him at the first place. Cause it's all happend
      without even conferming anything which got blame to the layer against
      them. Grey then asked why then even have a layer against them since it's
      not a normal court case where two parties debate. It's a lawful case where
      they only present evidence. No debate. The judge explains that the rules
      are rules. It helps them to look back at information and other things.
      That's why they keep a defender still against these proofs. Cause they
      need to check their truth. Grey has nothing against it since he just
      didn't knew it. Jessika was jailed. On the other hand grey was with
      stephine she apologised for douting him but grey didn't even knew she
      doubted him. Grey thn thinks that too much in the world is going on which
      he doesn't knows or figures out. It's not good but what he can do?
      Nothing. all he can do is focous the next time but will there even be a
      next time? Austin and sam are out of the investigation cause they already
      conducted a mission which alerted the main guy they were trying to catch
      and now he may not appear or even hide. The police are thinking of ending
      the case but they can't just right now cause they still have hope. At
      least some hope.
      <br />
      <br />
      stephine was being touchy with grey and asked him if they should get
      married. Grey asked her when. Stephine says that she was just asking. She
      didn't expected... she wants it to happen as soon as possible. Grey asks
      her if her daddy issues are acting up again. She tells grey that she just
      wants to... She wants to do stuff that they can't do unless married. Maybe
      she is willing to but grey. She's sure that he'll give an excuse before so
      like it's illigal or so on so forth. Grey tells her that they can get
      married two months later if that's what she wishes. She asks why that far.
      Grey tells her that her birthday is around that time so they both will be
      18 by that point. Stephine asks when is grye's birthday and grey tells her
      that it's something he doesn't want to talk about. She asks grey if he saw
      his own mother die or somthing. Grey tells her that he never even met his
      mother or father. He never had any siblings. So he carvs for love. She
      tells grey that she'll be his love then. she then thinks that she never
      thought she would fall in for someone like this. But for some reason she
      feels like she belongs and someone else belongs to her. That's what she
      always wanted. A few hours pass by and grey finds himself in an unknown
      filthy place where a child looks at him and tells him that he wants to be
      saved but he was killed. People around him is getting killed one by one.
      Everyone. Even stephine. Then a unknown guy calls grey his brother and
      tells him to have a nice day. and died. Grey calls him grace and wakes up
      from sleep. He had a nightmare. He went out to make cofee and stephine
      woke up. She asked grey if he was ok. Grey told her that he gets
      nightmares when he sleeps. So usually he puts on some short of news or at
      least someone talking around.
      <br />
      <br />
      cause othsewise the silence haunts him. Stephine tells grey that she's
      here for him if he feels the absence of someone. Grye decided to tell
      stephine something. He told stephine that he had a brother. His name was
      grace. Stephine asks if he was the son of camilio and grey tells her yes.
      Grey tells her that how he had some friends who were supposed to come to
      his house the day of his birthday. But something else happend that day. A
      girl endered the house cause she was invited. Grey was with her but she
      saw something and ran away from the house and grey followed her and she
      staretd causing a scean. Turns out she saw dead bodies with someone
      standing there. Grey didn't had the courage to see out if the killer was
      still there. After 30 minutes the police came and grey saw the dead
      bodies. Grey and grace were brothers. Later that day when she went home
      she asked grey for support since her parents weren't home. They will be
      coming a hour later. As said grey went to her house with her but he
      couldn't stop what happend. She was killed right before his eyes. All he
      could do is run. Like a cowerd. He was powerless. He still is. Stephine
      then asked about grey's father but grey had nothing to say about it. A
      week pass by and jessika was at the jail seving her sentence and wondered
      how the world would see her after this but something surprising happend.
      She was let go of. Her parents bailed her. Her fatehr was really
      dissopointed at her for not going to her when she was at such a situation.
      She was told not to do the same mistake again and she was happy that she
      got accepted. She was afraid to go to school since everyone would look at
      her like a criminal.
      <br />
      <br />
      But surpisingly eveyone treated her like usual and specially stephine and
      aria were acting nice to her. Some people were afraid of her since she
      littelery killed someone and there are rumours against her. The
      environment was slowly gettin toxic but her friends were supporting her
      telling her that they believe nothing what the world told them. They are
      not goanna treat her like a criminal just cause some past. They are trying
      to act nice to tell her that they forgave her but william wasn't too happy
      about it since she was the killer of kevin. While william was walking home
      grey joined him and asked him about jessika and what he thinks about her.
      He explains that he won't be able to see her the same way since she killed
      his friend. A litteler teacher. Grey told william that but she never did
      it herself. Another guy killed him and suffocated him and told jessika to
      finish him off even though he was dead already. The medical reports were
      clear that it's the doing of a man. Not some 12 year old girl. William was
      confused and asked grey why she was put into jail then and grey explains
      that it was more about her revealing kevin's name to get killed. Even
      though she herself didn't killed him she told his name which is why she is
      indirectly responcible for his death. Of course she isn't told about
      kevin's death since the police thought that it would be best she would
      live under the impression that she killed someone cause it's not entirely
      false. It would increate her guild causing her not to even look back ever.
      <br />
      <br />
      William asks what made grey to tell him about it. Grey explained him that
      it's so that at least he can understand what kind of situation she was in.
      Grey is preety sure that even he himself would have done the same. William
      says he wouldn't cause he would try to fight back. Grey asks william again
      that if you are a 8 year old school girl and you are blammed for a murder
      and there are some people who are telling you to do as they please you are
      bind to do whatever they tell you to do no matter what. Grey doesn't sees
      that there is anything that he wouldn't have done differnt if he was her
      but at least things can change now and no one should be blammed for what
      happend in the past. People change. Don't they? The day ended and grey
      went home thinking what may have happend to austin and the case thingi. Of
      course the police are keeping an eye on jessika by talking to her parents
      and school daily. But this is treated her like a criminal insted of her
      safety. She feels like everything is falling apart. Yes she escaped hell
      and finally can sleep peacefully at her house but... She get's a call and
      it's someone telling her something. She ends the call by saying that he
      should be ready for her answer. On the other side the substitute police is
      under duty now. He's a fat nobody who seems like he may do something
      horrible. Before leaving sam asks that substitue police what he'll be
      doing right now and he explains that he'll be investigating the seiged
      place and all the details of the case carefully and reach to a conclusion.
      Sam asks what he'll be doing after that and the substitue police tells sam
      that he has done a bad work by catching a branch. There is nothing can be
      done right now. If they don't reach to any conclusitions then they'll have
      to end the case and sam is angry but he can't do anything. Sam calls
      austin and explains his frustrations and austin told everything about grey
      which surprises sam and sam is like grey's life is in the most danger in
      right now if they don't do anything.
      <br />
      <br />
      The media didn't made him into a hero. They made his life worse. Austin
      asks what sam plans to do right now and sam explains that he needs to add
      guys to protect guy or even keep an eye on him cause thing may not look if
      nothing is done. On the other side jessika is looking at her bag before
      william calls if jessika is present and she says yes. Then at school time
      her mind was somewhere else. She asked grey during such time if he is
      willing to be with her. Straight proposal. Grey explains to her that he
      already promiced to stephine that they'll get married. Grey tells jessika
      sorry and she leaves after thanking grey for saving her life and grey
      tells her that her life would have been saved regadless of whoever it was.
      She tells grey that even if it's a coincedence for grey saving her, she is
      still thanful for that coincecdence cause grey was there. She leaves and
      grey smells something wierd in her words. So he decided to to the
      direction jessika went to. To see what she's upto. Jessika was holding her
      bag and she asked another guy to meet somewhere private and that guy
      seemed normal. Just a classmate of grey and all but something surprising
      happend. She pulled out and a gun and was about to shoot him cause for
      something. that guy didn't wanted to get shot but grey came to save the
      day but throwing her gun away. Grey told that guy to call the police. Grey
      thought she felt guilt for killing kevin but why is she here to kill
      another guy. Jessika told grey that he's making a mistake which is true.
      That guy whom grey just saved picked up the gun and pointed it at grey's
      head and told him that he was ordered to kill grey. No big deal then.
      Before that guy could even pull the trigger grey clutched to the gun.
      <br />
      <br />
      caught it and shot all the bullets on his legs. Grey then punched that guy
      and asked him who told him to kill him. That guy explained that he
      recieved money for it. A flash back. Jessika got a call from that guy? He
      explaind to jessika that akio is coming to the city to kill all of them.
      Including jessika. She can't run. Only thing she can do is beg her life
      out of it and that's the only way she can be saved. Jessika said she will
      wait for her answer and grabbed something. A bottle looking thing and a
      gun. A flash back is seen. Jessika got that gun from those two guys who
      tortured her. It's to use when they tell her so. Of course she may wish to
      use to get out of their caught but only thing she'll get out of it is
      death sentence. She can't run forever. a call is heard. Grey hears the
      phone in the other pocket ringing. Insain luck. Grey picks up the call and
      asks who it is and akio asks if that guy is on phone. Grey asks if he's
      akio kimuira. AKio started laughing and asked grey why he thinks he can
      get in his way and possibly live. Grey says that it's cause more than half
      of the world is with him to catch people like him. Even if grey dies one
      day he'll have to die himself or pay for what he did in his life. He can't
      run away forever. And also grey hasn't paid back the debt akio gave him
      to. He laughs and ends the call. The police came and the person who is
      shot needs to go to the hospital first and jessika is going to jail again.
      Grey asks her that she could have told grye if she felt frightend. Jessika
      told grey that why should she even have faith in him if he's not hers.
      Maybe that was a option but she has done what's done. She truely wished
      she could have trusted on grey.
      <br />
      <br />
      Then he could have done more maybe. But it's not her consern anymore. She
      loved grey and wished he became her mental support. Grey told her that he
      was always there for her. Just forgot to tell her in the right moment.
      Jessika ate something. It's poison. She dies there at the moment. Jessika
      can't tell her parents and think they treate her well. She can't go and
      have her friends know her past and pretend that she's in a good moment.
      But she can feel hope if someone she loves supports her. Maybe a cuple of
      kisses is what she wanted. But it's too late already.

    <h2>Arc 7- Griffin and Grey</h2>
    <p>
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey is taken to the police station to explain everything that happend.
      Jessika's body is taken for post mortem even though there is nothing
      intresting about it. She killed herself. She had a gun from the start yet
      the police didn't found it when they inspected her house. That means she
      kept them somewhere else. And the poison. Why didn't anyone question about
      it? Was it cause the glass was empty or something and she put the poison
      in a different container. The inspection of police were lacking. Grey
      wonderd that he was lucky all this time information coming to him. If he
      were to guess it would be too big of a coincedence in life. In in
      trillions or something but everything that happens in life leads to coince
      dence. It's just a part of conenuety that they can't escape. He needs to
      learn to calculate this continuety and shape it as he pleases as his own.
      Other wise he can't manupulate the sorrunding around him to as he pleases.
      Everything can't be don'e just cause of someone with higher power
      influenced. He always told himself. That what is the differnce between two
      people. He has hands. I have hands. He has a humen body. I have a humen
      body. He uses it to kill and grey... They are no different. So why is the
      next person in term of more power? The fact is they are not in different
      power. All humen have the same power.
      <br />
      <br />
      That's manupulation. A govt maupulates the people to get in control. A
      king trains his people to fight for him. And his strength is man power he
      has. Grey can't work alone. Just not possible. Grey needs people that he
      can control to win this thing that started. A game of chess he didn't
      start but has to fight. And he will win. On the other side stephine was
      worried about grey and everything and griffin came to talk to her. He told
      her to think something carefully and she should break up with grey. On the
      other side The new police man tries to blame grey for what he did and he
      blames grey to be sceaming as since he's with the killer. The guy brings
      out some points and blames grey that he's trying to manupulate the police
      and he's leaking insider information and he needs to be locked. Sam comes
      in grey's aid and tells the new guy that he can't just arrest someone
      based on suspecission and the new guy tells sam that all he needs is some
      nice little interogation for grey to spit everything. Grey is disguested
      since this country and india does not go based on logic. The police are
      mostly corrupt. They work based on suspecion and they are most of the time
      affective for their methods but the moment they run out of evidence to
      blame someone they turn into this resort. Beat the shit out of those they
      have suspecissions. Those who did the crime will just spit up the truth.
      <br />
      <br />
      On the other hand the person who is being balmmed rather accept the fake
      claim rather than speak the truth. Matter of fact it's common in their
      county. Just last ear a person made a recherch on psychology but the govt
      has not taken any action on it or any law in it. The police are not bad
      people but people like these who make the real mess. They are not smart
      enough to conduct investigation. Most people take physic to get into
      police but often they miss out main compotents that miss out to select
      police. Specially govt police. On the other side griffin is brain washing
      stephine telling her that grey is manupulating her. He is making up stuff.
      He does all the time is lies. He told everything to her lies and even
      managed to convince her to marry him. That's cause grey is a total moron
      who only has self intrest. Stephine get's angry and asks why griffin
      thinks such way. Isn't he his best friend. Griffin reveals that grey is a
      lier. He asks if he claimed to be the son of camilio or something. Cause
      that's a lie. He was born an orphan. in this country and then got adopted
      by someone. They went to a different country. There his parents died. He's
      been so spoiled that he didn't even cried when camilio died. The person
      who adopted him. He's not greatful. Grey never had any emotion when he got
      himself killed another girl who saw the murder with him. He's a traitor.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine doesn't believes it. Griffin explains that grey may have told her
      some of it to makie her fall for him. Cause in the end he's after her
      father's property. Griffin explains how grey once told grey about how to
      maupulate women. They all need is create a situation of need when a girl
      thinks she is needed and falls in love without noticing but that's just
      how their psychology works. Any given person can take use of such things
      of girls. Stephine after hearing it understands something but she is still
      having hard time figuring out what is happening. Stephine doesn't has a
      reason to get out of this relation and thinks that life with grey is going
      nicer. Griffin tells her that if she's having hard time finding a reason
      to break up then he could be her reason. Griffin proposes her. On the
      other side sam promices grey that he'll never tell anyone about his past
      and grey tells sam that he doesn't want the world to know his vaunerblity
      that he was an orphan. Maybe it's not much of a detail but not everyone
      knows the truth of grey. Most people don't know but some who knows
      believes that grey is camilio's son. He doesn't need to change that cause
      he was indeed adopted by her but doesn't cares cause he doesn't want to
      feel guilty for anything that has already happend. Nothing can be done
      right now. Sam tells grey that he should return home.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey decided to go home but when he came home something wierd happend. He
      saw that stephine wasn't home and nothing that she had was there. He
      wondered if she left. Why did she leave. This sudden without tellling him.
      Grey called stephine and she asked grey if grey lied about his family to
      get symphyty. Grey explained that he didn't lied cause he wanted symphyty.
      He just didn't wanted her to know that he was originally a nobody. Maby
      grey would be treated well from her or some short of sence of incurity
      that he has on. Stephine then tells grey that she understands that grey
      told her all lies to trap her in his dilutions. Grey didn't understood her
      and asked what she means and stephine tells grey that they are done. She
      has returned to her home. Grey then understood that stephine is trying to
      blame grey for everything but in truth she was alrways the bitch she was
      ment to be. Grey thought she was missunderstood but turns out she was the
      biggest snake that grey got. Grey told stephine that she has no value for
      emotions but grey does but it doesn't matter. Does it right now. Stephine
      wants to know if he has anything else to say. Grey tells her that well
      played griffin. He ends the call. Griffin was in that room with stephine
      and he was leaving. Stephine didn't understood the meaning of grey's word
      but she asked grifffin what is the meaning of this.
      <br />
      <br />
      He told stephine that he likes her and that's why she should get out of
      this. Griffin told stephine that he told her a lie. A lie for the better
      ment of grey. Stephine didn't understood. Griffin explained that grey
      should be alone right now collect his thoughts and don't get involbed into
      this cause his involbement in the recent stuff has made quite an inpact.
      Stephine's life could be theretend for grey's fault and that's true. He
      has created a mess that he needs to clean up. Before that having family is
      like having a weekness. That's what griffin thinks is going on. Griffin
      did it for both of them. On top of that stephine is a gold digger and
      that's seen by griffin. She left grey for griffin. That's not good.
      Griffin wont let grey someone he loves like a brother have a girfriend
      like her. Insted of being binded right now with no exit he closed the door
      even before it opend. Griffin tells stephine that he never wishes to meet
      her and told stephine that grey was a lier just like stephine but it
      doesn't matter cause he may have his own reasons for lying but for
      symphyty. That's only something stephine can do. Her father left her? She
      wasn't even bron when that happend. Stephine get's emotional and tells
      griffin that she wasn't lying. She met her father once. Griffin asked if
      it was only once? Then it doesn't counts. She's a lier regardless. She
      can't believe that she got played. She played with her words with people
      but she didn't wished to play with grey's heart cause he was someone she
      could relate to.
      <br />
      <br />
      But in the end she was done wrong. She tells griffin that he won't get
      away with this. She is crying in her room alone. On the other side grey is
      in his house wondering that it feels empty again. He can't live in an
      empty house cause it is sad for him to live in an empty house. He wants to
      be filled in a house with people. Children and someone he loves. Not with
      life less objects. He remembers that his brother died in that room. He
      remembers that day very well. It's sufocating to live a silent life like
      this. Grey gets a call. On the other side stephine is seen and she wonders
      how grey is cause he can't sleep without someone he holds. He can't sleep
      if there is no one. No sound. No sound of someone living. someone
      breathing. She wonderes if she has any door left for her to get back. On
      the other side arvin tells grey about the school festival. It's goanna be
      haulted. For a unknown period of time cause of the recent events. Grey is
      having a hard time breathing. He asks arving if he has any problem if grey
      wants to stay at his place for the day. Arvin tells grey a big no since he
      is with aria. Grey is confused. They are under 18. Arvin tells grey that
      they are just a few months away from 18. Not a big deal. Grey thought that
      this age is getting wrong. Why is people so careless.
      <br />
      <br />
      Arvin asks if something happend. Grey explained that griffin back stabbed
      him. he took away stephine. Arvin told grey that he did the best thing and
      grey should realize that he's leaving him now, what will happend next?
      they'll have kids, grey'll get mentally attached and then what. She's
      goanna leave the kids and him for a another man. Grey told arvin that he's
      missunderstanding it. He never intended to find true love. He knew
      something was up with stephine and she's goanna betray him anyways. But he
      wished to let her in. Just so he can feel full agiain. He's now empty.
      It's been 10 entire year since he's without a family memeber. After that
      now someone came and grey thought he could live a life of comfort and this
      happend. He can't do anything. Let alone find the killer of his parents.
      Arvin told grey to take a deep breath and calm down. He knows that grey
      doesn't like using his brain but this is the time. He can't just think
      that it's good time for him to work. In a good time. There will be good
      times and bad timese in life. He can't loose mentally if he isn't willing
      to work when it's a bad time. He needs to keep going on and when the next
      time good time comes for him he can expect his win by then. Think ahead
      grey. Grey then wonderes if he should even consider giving up since he is
      no detective. Arvin tells grey that he certainly isn't.
      <br />
      <br />
      Matter of fact he is a very normal person in the world who happend to have
      a big ambition. To find the killer of his parent. His mother and brother.
      And it's completely fine to think that you are not capable to find him or
      do such thing but grey should remember his own saying. He has two arms, he
      has two arms. He has a body , he has a body. What's the difference between
      them. It's nothing. Nothing is different. He can be something or find
      something he wants if he's at it. The honest way. He's bound to reach his
      destination. Grey feels motivated and thanks arvin. Arvin then tells grey
      that he can come to his house if he feels free whever he wants. Grey tells
      arvin that he has already done enough for him but now it's time for him to
      something. Grey tells arvin that the farewell party will happen. Not after
      delay. It'll happen at the intended day. Weither the school wants it or
      not. Grey thinks up something and he says back to work. On a different
      part of the world steven is called by someone and steven tells that person
      that he can't even finish a work properly. that's sad. Steven says that
      he'll not be able to visit there and they have to take care of everything
      by themselves and yes he doesn't want the same woman enter his bed room
      anymore. The festival day comes and grey was watching the starts and
      wondering if he dies here he won't regert anything. That's what he wants.
      If he ever dies he wants to die under the night sky with lots of stars in
      the sky. The party is going at full swing. Grey is sittin alone in th
      school roof and ali comes to aid grey and asks why he wants to die like
      that and grey explains that it sounds peaceful. Griffin enters the place
      and tells grey that it would be nice if he managed to die like that but
      will he be happy then? Doesn't he wants a family.
      <br />
      <br />
      Consisting of someone he loves and children. Grey tried to leave the place
      but griffin wants to argue. He tells grey that he has nothing with
      stephine and grey never said he said he has. He doesn't likes the idea of
      such thing griffin doing to him. Griffin then asked if he himself wants to
      accept stephine after this. Grey says that he won't be able to. Maybe for
      now. Griffin tells grey to find true love. He's picking anyone whom he
      finds when he needs to find true love. Grey says that he accepts that it's
      true. Stephine was hearing them. Grey explains that he feels empty and he
      can't take it anymore. He just wanted someone. He could have been with
      jessika. He never loved anyone. He just wanted someone he can share his
      love with. Even if it ment strangers or someone you don't love at all. He
      just wanted to be loved. Jessika killed herself cause grey didn't accepted
      her for stephine. Grey thinks that he made a mistake by even getting in a
      relation with stephine. But that wont bring back jessika. He sounds like a
      scum who plays with girls but he just wants someone. At least someone. and
      he feels like a foold just thinking that he missed out on an oppurchuni on
      missing someone who actually loved him. Someone who actually needed him
      and he needed that one person. Never mind. It sounds like we are
      bargaining market price of a product. Griffin tells grey that it's not
      wrong to feel like it or even think that he could have been with someone
      or even talk like they are market products cause in the end they are
      indeed someone outsider they consider as liftime. They need the best
      person to be their partner since it's about life time.
      <br />
      <br />

      It's not wrong to think that you missed out on a big deal. Grey tells
      griffin that he should shut up. Cause it's not like he can find true love
      that easily. There are billions of people in the world out there. That
      grey doens't knows of. It's not like he's judging peopl's body quality. He
      just wants someone faithful. Griffin tells grey that then find someone
      faith ful. Maybe he can help him. He alwasy was there. And all of his
      friends were there to introduce hi to people if he wants. Grey thinks and
      tells griffin that he doesn't feel like it. He just wants to go home and
      lay on the bed. Ali teases grey by saying that doesn't he want also a body
      pilloe but grey also goes along it and says that he wants to replace it
      with an actual person if possible and they leave while laughing. On the
      other side stephine is leaving that place and is meeting up with aria and
      she asks where stephine was and she told aria nothing. They starte their
      convestation by how stephine is actually a bad person since she decieves
      people. Aria gives her genuien thoughts on her that she is decieveing
      without noticing it herself sometimes. And she needs to fix it cause no on
      trusts her anymore. Stephine is angry. She sees grey and wants to hide.
      She doesn't wants to face grey cause she feels shameful. She could just
      talk things out to him acording to aria since she is having a hard time
      deraling with emotions.
      <br />
      <br />
      Maybe she can try to be a better person from now on and try to earn
      people's trust from now on. Stephine gathers courage and faces grey and
      tells him that she wants to talk to him. They talk and grey straight
      rejects her and tells her that he didn't wanted to pretend as he said. He
      doesn't likes fake relations but he still got into it cause he wanted
      something. But maybe it's time for him to learn. He says sorry and leaves.
      Someone comes and grabs stephine and stabs her in front of grey which is
      surprising for grey and he was shocked. The guy tried to run away but grey
      was tryig to see if stephine is alive or not. Grey layed her on the ground
      and when the guy tried to walk out of the place grey caught him and beat
      him to hell and almost killed him but griffin came to stop him. It costed
      him some blood. Everyone was shocked to see grey's anger. Grey explained
      to griffin that that guy stabbed stephine. But that guy took the knife
      from griffins hands and tried to frighten everyone that he'll kill griffin
      if someone dares to move. Grey started clapping and told griffin to look
      at himself. Where he is right now. That's whom he tried to save just now.
      Grey was really mad right now and grey tried to punch that guy and even
      managed to do it and freed griffin but that guy brought a gun and almost
      fired it at grey but another gun shot was heard. Austin was there.
      <br />
      <br />
      He shot him and saved grey. Stephine was taken to hospital and everyone
      was confused. The new officer came to investigate everything and he told
      everyone to hold this party thing cause people are dying right now and
      they are not taking it seriously. They don't seriously want to die. Grey
      was blammed for it since he was the one who took care of every management
      himself to build it. Aria then blammed grey cause stephine went to meet
      grey and grey explained that she did but things happend so out of a blink.
      Arvin then pointed out that the seisors were the exact pair grey used
      during their work. Another guy blammed grey for kiling stephine since he
      saw grey holding her body. Everyone suddenly for no reason went against
      grey. The new police blammed everything to grey cause he thought that grey
      wanted to marry stephine so he could take all his walth but when she
      rejected he killed her using another guy. That guy was with them. When
      asked he said it was grey's plan. Grey tells that he's obiously lying to
      cover up. The new police tells grey that he's under arrest. Grey tries to
      resist but he tells his friends that he didn't do anything but he saw
      something wierd in their eyes. He could tell that they don't believe him.
      He has nothing to do right now. Everything was against him.
      <br />
      <br />
      Austin thought for a moment and told the new police man that he knows that
      grey did nothing and he's goanna prove it. Grey tells austin that he needs
      not to prove anything. Grey tells austin to keep his moute shut which
      inrages the new guy who started interogating him on spot and started
      asking him questions like why and other stuff and what kind of relations
      he has with crime. Grey felt humeliated. He felt like he should die. He
      punched the police and said he doesn't want to go anywhere. He isn't gulty
      of anything and it's his own personal intrest to blame grey to get off
      everything. He tries to get out of the place but fails. They took grey
      into custody. There they hurted grey a lot to bring up what they think is
      the truth even though it isn't. Grey was screaming. He thought that he was
      a smart guy but even at the blink of danger his true colors start coming
      up. Grey stopps screaming which confuses the people beating him. On the
      other side griffin and everyone was confused and griffin told everyone
      that it doesn't matter what the world thinks but he doesn't believes that
      grey could do anything like that and they were absulute idiot to even
      think that grey did something wrong and blame everything to him. Ali
      explained that he was confused. Arvin thinks and says that it's
      practically impossible for grey to do somthing like that cause if he
      really did something like that then he would have to be a criminal since
      childhood. Griffin explains that there is other ways too but he won't go
      too in dept cause he doesn't believes that grey is a criminal short. Aria
      was confused and asked what will happen of him then. Griffin explained
      that nothing will happen to him since they can't prove anything against
      him. Or at least they can hope so. On this side austin was arguing with
      the new police as well as sam but none of them can do anything right now
      cause he is in charge. Austin proves that it wasn't grye by proving using
      cctv footage.
      <br />
      <br />
      It's clear that grey wasn't there at the right moment to do the killings.
      The new police explains that he may have some partner in crome or
      whatever. He's conducting his own investigation. He asks if grey has brain
      washed austin or something. Cause it's clear that he himself knows that he
      has austin's power to help. Austin was helpless. That's when they
      encounter another shock. Grey confessed his guilt. The new police starts
      laughing. Austin went to grey to ask why grey did that and grey explained
      to austin that he thought he was strong. He thought having the power to
      change is real power. But in reality it's something physical. The people
      who are in pwoer can torture him. The people in power can kill him. And
      the people in power can free him. Grey told somthing to austin and austin
      told grey that he'll try his best. It's time for grey's back story. He
      used to be an orphan in a distant land. He grew up in filth. Grey's life
      was all searching for food in filth or just beg for money. He a lot of
      times got beated by adults who blammed him of stealing. He once lied to
      get in a cinema plex to watch movie but it caused him to beaten to pump
      and grey was ashamed of himself. He lied and people treat him like filth.
      Maybe that's cause he is filth. He had some piece of money and he spend it
      all in a arcade.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey wants to live a happy life where he can play games like eveyday.
      there was a kunfu teaching school near by. They taught that diciplin and
      dedicatin is the greatest source of power. There was another granpa type
      guy who told grey that that's not true. People who can manupulate their
      sorrundings are the real powerful people. The richest person in the world
      now a days are the people who sorrund themselves using useful people who
      can work for them. Of course hard work is needed but that also means that
      you need to work smart to be at the top. Grey tells that he doesn't want
      to be at the top. He just want to be somewhere comfortable. Somewhat
      liveable. The granpa looking person asked grey if he wants to eat anything
      and grey responds with a yes. He brought filt to the place. The grandpa
      looking person asked what grey wants to be in life and he doesn't has an
      answer. He just wants to live. A proper life. A life with infinite money
      may be pleasing but you'll always be in a place where pelple have a option
      to back stab you even if they don't actually do it. And a family is all he
      needs cause who cares for him. That's why he wants someone who will care
      for him. The gramps didn't understood the telling of grye so grey
      explained to him that he needs to grow up soon so he can have wife and
      kids. That would be so perfect. For that he needs to have money and a job.
      <br />
      <br />
      For that he wants to study. The granpa looking guy laughs a bit and asks
      grey why he doesn't want a father or parent. Grey explains that he doesn't
      knows it himself but he doesn't likes when adults scream at him. The
      grandpa asks grey's age and he tells him that he's 4 or that's what he
      remembers. And grey tells grams to give him a name insted of telling him
      his own name. A year pass by. Grey is doing work after work. He's 5 but
      he's already lifting kg of things and working as work loader. He's helping
      people of trucks to bring down things. And helping in stores and at the
      end of the day he's cleaning granpa's house and cleaning the dirty dishes
      and getting a little amount of food by him. He's gretful for whatever he's
      getting. Grandpa wasn't a very good person cause he never gave grey enough
      for his payment. Grey wanted more so he went to ask for a raise but granpa
      explained that he can't give grey anymore than he's doing. He has already
      gave him a staying place and food. What else does he needs. Grey couldn't
      argue. A few days later grand pa died and he left all his property to
      grey's name. Grey was happy that he at least has something for now. even
      though he was sad. He wasn't so sad at first cause he never liked grandpa
      but he left all and everything to grey. This makes grye feel guilty and he
      thinks that he's not being nice to a dead person by having grudges.
      <br />
      <br />
      He doesn't want to be spole himself. But the next thing grey knew was some
      person named griffin came to adopt grey. It was for waht? The left over
      property. He was already rich and never looked back at his father. Then
      why did he came back? for to tke eveyr bit of money from a helpless child.
      Grey wasn't treated well. He felt like that cause his brother grace got
      all the appreaciation and everything he wanted. Grey wanted something but
      grace got everything. Grey wanted a pc cause he wanted to play games.
      Griffin didn't allowed it. Eventhough grey explained that his granpa left
      money for him and he should get what he wants. Griffin got angry and
      slapped grey and told him not to show his temper against him cause he's a
      filthy nobody. Griffin can send him back to where he found him. He
      shouldn't pretend so mighty with him. Grey started crying and left to his
      room. Griffin for a second looked at himself and thought what he's doing.
      He's just a child raided in filth. Of course he'll do such demands once
      he's on hold of money. At this point of time grey was with grace who tried
      to console grey. Grey doesn't likes grace cause he gets everything he
      wishes. Grey doesn't. It's not cause he's not their son. They don't know
      grey yet and on top of everythig they are raisist towards poor people and
      they don't value people who have less money. Why do people treat other
      people based on how rich they are. Is money their source of power. It must
      be cause they can buy everything. Grey remembers his days on the arcade.
      <br />
      <br />
      He wants a pc. Griffin got in a good mood and he decided to buy grey a pc
      cause he wanted it so bad for a long time. Grey started using it and felt
      like a cerstain unknowness since he wasn't familier with anything. Grey
      slowly figured out everything and helped download some games with grace.
      But after that grace forgot grey. Grace always was on the pc even though
      grey was whom the pc was bought for. Griffin then once brought grey to his
      office and he felt like everything was cool and he was a curious boy.
      Silent but he didn't feared anything or anyone. Even humen sceletion. He
      even didn't hasitated to touch a deadboy which was in a medical room.
      Griffin told grey not to touch everything he sees and grey did as he said.
      Austin was there who met grey for the first time so he asked grey his name
      and grey directly told austin that he doens't feels the necesserity to
      tell austin his name which rages griffin. Griffin get's a call and he
      decided to leave early. After that day griffin was never seen. Grey was
      taken by austin to blood test cause they found a certain body after
      griffin got lost. They don't know if it's griffin or not.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey told austin that he isn't blood related to griffin which surprises
      him. Austin didn't knew that fact. A few days pass by and a news is heard
      throw out the entire earth that the billionair owner of a certain comapny
      died. Steven was there. He was furious but he managed to secure his place
      in the company as the ceo. Even though he isn't the owner he'll compensate
      for his family by giving them money enough for living. On this side
      griffins wife was furious. Camilio was griffin's wife. He wanted to sell
      grey's pc and everything else. Grey told camilio that it's useless cause
      they don't value as much as they used to. A second hand product will cause
      50% loss if she decided to sell them. Camilio didn't wanted to sell it
      now. Grey lied. He understands camilio's psychology so he said it such
      way. Usually pc parts can be sold in any way. It's just the buyer who
      needs to agree. Matter of fact the pc itself can be sold more than it used
      to be cause of the price increase of products due to inflation of recent
      years. Specially when a person who wants to buy good intacted pc which has
      nice specs and is working. Grey decided that he doesn't want to turn a bad
      person but he'll if that means he will be in control insted of other
      people. Grey used to do grace's homework since they used to go the the
      same school. When it was the first day at school for grace since he
      transfared his mom introduced him as his son and grey got saved since he
      wasn't.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey is controlling grace by his homsework and other stuff. He knows his
      life performace and everything. He won't have a problem in controlling
      grace. But what about camilio. Grey realized that william and kevin likes
      camilio but he knows that kevin is more dilutional than william so he
      decided to tell kevin lies that camilio feels lonely and she needs somoene
      and grace feels loneley without a father. Of course he didn't do it
      direcly but he did it such a way no one can tell it was his doing. After
      being close enough to kevin grey told kevin everything camilio likes and
      all. Everything was going acording to plan but william got into a fight
      with keving cause both of them liked camilio and both of them careated a
      huge quarell in the school. This info of the news caused camilio not
      accept any of their proposals. Grey's plan failed. Grey had no way to
      control her but to depent it on the situation which is scarier. Only if he
      was smarter. In home camilio compared grey's results with graces. Grace
      had lower results. Grey blammed greace that he always is on the pc when
      dad bought it for him. Grace explains that grey was always doing homework
      and grey explains that that's cause he never get's the chance to play an
      actual game. All he can do is watch tv all day which is boring. It's
      reflecting on grace's grades that he needs to move and give him what was
      originally his. Camilio agrees and grey leaves. Grey got his full control
      and he remembers while talking to someone camilio reveald that she is
      actually doing it so grace get's better grades. She doesn't cares if grey
      get's good or not. He'll figure it out himself. She's more consern with
      grace insted of grace which is good since grey can get away with most
      stuff when grace can't.
      <br />
      <br />
      But that also means he won't be in favore. In school grey was doing his
      own homework and subbited it on time and grace asked grey that he's
      thankful for grey doing his homework but if he's goanna miss his own
      homsework then what's the point. Grey tells grace that he won't. Either
      way it doesn't matter. Grace then tells grey that it's his birthday and
      what's grey going to give him this year. Grey argues with grace that they
      need to tell eveyone that he's camilio's son too. Grace promices that
      he'll explain it to everyone once the party is going on. Maybe surprise it
      a bit. Grey tells grace that he won't be getting anythign from him as
      usual. Grace asked grey to do something for him. Grey thought for a while
      and thought that he has the perfect thing for grace. Grey gave grace a
      smart watch which costs only a thousand something. Grace takes it to
      school and get's in truble and he even breaks it. Grey scols grace that he
      broke it so easily. He won't give him anything from now on. Grace was sad.
      Grey then reveals that he intentionally gave such thing to grace cause he
      knew it would break too early and the fact he came to school with it will
      definetely get him scoleded to school. That's when grey met with griffin
      and other stuff. THey knew eachtoerh for long enough. Grey doesn't really
      hate griffin but grey is tired of everything. He doesn't want to do any of
      this. He is having fun in doing such thing but when today gracec got
      slapped for doing something that was grey's fault.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey felt real sad when grace cried for it. He didn't wanted someone else
      loose their cause of smile for his entertainment. He's not controlling
      anybody from now on even if it was fun. He can do it for longer but not
      anymore. Grffin hanged out with grey and other stuff. Griffin was cheerful
      and normal but he's considered a genious and griffin knows that grey is
      better than him. Grey tells griffin that it doesn't matter who has the
      better potential cause it's the person who manages to succed is the
      acomplished one. Grace's birthday party is today. Grace tried to talk to a
      girl to invite her to his birthday but grey saw it and realized that grey
      can do something about it but he instantly rememberd that grace was sad
      cause of him. So insted grey got intel that she's just a normal person
      with normal family. Grey knows that he needs to convince her to like grace
      so grey tells her that she looks like shit and she shouldn't be with
      grace. He's a falure. This reverse psychology works. Grey then spreads
      missinformation using griffin that grace is actually an idiot but that
      girl catches griffin doing so and scolds him. It was grey and griffin's
      plan. The class ends and grace is told that that girl doesn't likes grey
      but she is intrested in grace. Greace tells her that grey is his brother
      and he doesn't cares if he spreads missinformation about him.
      <br />
      <br />
      All that matters is that they don't have internal conflict. The day pass
      by and jessika was walking home when a guy asked her way to road and then
      that guy kidnapped her and asked her all she knows about camilio and all.
      She reveals everything but she doesn't knows that grey is even part of the
      family. Akio kimura is seen with his full face. Grey get's into a fight
      with his mother cause of grace and all cause of different treatment and he
      doesn't want to be a part of the family anymore. In the exact moment
      someone else entered the hosue. He leaves thinking that he started at
      worse. He doesn't knows if he'll get lucky again and be picekd up by any
      rich family. He should return cause it'll be foolishness to think he can
      have any short of family attachments from this fake family. He decided to
      retun. He wonders if he should kill his emotions cause they have no use
      for him right now. He is going back home. On the other side the girl is
      going to grey's homse to graces' birthday. She is terriefied cause she saw
      two dead bodies in grey's house. Grey's entire family was slaughered. It
      became quite a case. Austin was in charge of the chase again. He saw the
      same mark in the back of both of those people. He saw the same mark in
      griffin's back. A case of a psychopath. The fact grey is camilio's adopted
      son is kept secret. And the girl who thought she saw the killer tried to
      help the police. A few days later grey heard that austin is retiring and
      grey didn't undderstood why. Ausitn explained that it was cause he's a
      falire and he let his entire family die and couldn't do anything as the
      police.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey tried to console austin saying that he did his best. On the other
      side Kevin was furious that the policee stopped conducting investigation
      and william tried to stop him but kevin was too furious. He stopped being
      a teacher and everything and dedicated his life towards trying to find the
      killer of camilio. on the other side grey went to see that girl who saw
      the murder of grey's family. Grey wanted to learn as much as himself. WHo
      knows if he figures something out simself. He goes to talk to the girl who
      saw the murder and she explains that she saw nothing much but from her
      discription it's clear the killer was still present during the event. And
      she reaveals something wierd that she even hear someone say something.
      Before she could say it Grey felt something wierd and a sound so he went
      to see what happend but he heard something else. Someone broke into the
      house and murdered the girl and put a finger on his lips as if he's
      telling grey to stay silent. Grey runs awaya from the place and further
      police investigation starts. It's the new police guy who conducted the
      investigation and tried to take side with grye that that child is sacred
      so it would be best to give him time. But he hardly found anything worth
      investigating for. That made quite an impact on that guy's life. He
      doesn't likes grey cause so much effort for such a nothing like
      information.
      <br />
      <br />
      There's nothing that can be done for now to catch that guy. Two new
      students are introduced in the school and grey met them but only one of
      the three best friends knows his truth that he's the son of one of the
      teacher. Grey was so scared and truamatized that he was scared of sleeping
      alone and always kept a stream or something on on his pc to make sure the
      same invironment is created when he had family. Grey feels really sad for
      loosing his family. He wonderes if he's a curse or something like that
      cause everyone he meets ends up dying. A few years pass by and grey met
      stephine but he doesn't remembers her anymore. A few weeks later when grey
      was 12 grey was surprised to meet kevin who asked grey something about
      camilio's life as well as griffins like and while talking grey figured out
      that there was a guy named makin who may be a suspect along with steven.
      Kevin tells grey that both of them are involbed. Grey doesn't knows how
      but it was fun to know. Kevin tells grey how maxin used to be griffins
      friend as well as camilio's ex. Could something like that be the cause of
      killing. Grey doesn't thinks so cause there has to be higher cause someone
      is littelery causing causing murder for it. Grey doesn't knows it but
      there could be a chance if he conducted investigation himself but he's
      afraid of dying. He doens't want to find anyone. He just wants to live his
      life free of thinking that he will die by murder. It's frightening.
      <br />
      <br />
      Kevin tells grey that 8-9 years ago maxin fleed from home and that was the
      exact time his family got murdered. But acording to his sister he fleed
      from home cause of the misstreatment he got after he faled yet another
      interview. Kevin is sure that maxin is the guy who's causing all this.
      Grey doesn't knows and wants to know kevins source but realizes that he's
      getting involbed into this too much and decided not to ask anything cause
      it's better not to know anything cause it'll be better. Kevin left with
      his questions answered and grey thought if kevin is going to be the one
      solving the case. He wonderes if there will be a award for him. Can grey
      finally sleep at night without the fear of someone killing him or the fear
      of being alone. Grey at this point knows that his unwillingness to
      elaborate with the case has caused some lifespam. He wont throw it up now.
      Then kevin was killed by jessika. Grey was shocked and dissopointed but
      what else can he do. All he can do for now is cry or maybe something more
      but he's a cowerd and a lier. He can't do anything. He's powerless. Then
      another few years pass by and grey is 16 now and grey just heard that
      stephine is in a relation with arvin and everythin is going good. that's
      when suddenly griffin tells grey if he's orphan and is originally from
      this country then how did he end up in that country. Grey thinks about it
      and then goes back to the country he was from before and talked to a unkle
      type guy and also steven who proposed to grey that his daughter should
      marry grey and grey told steven that his daughter is having a relation
      with another guy right now. How will he even know if he left his family
      beyhind.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey went side track but went to learn about his birth and everything. He
      went to the filthy place where he grew up in and then he went to some
      short of local hospital that doesn't exist anymore. He met with another
      place and figured out everything. His family consisted of a normal father
      and mother. they went to vecation with their new born baby who is one year
      old. That explains how grey is actually five when he touhght he was four.
      He's a year older than what he really is. He realized that he has a real
      family blood relatives that are alive. Grey's real parents died of some
      short of accident in that country. Grey grew up in the local market filth.
      Grey returns home and talks to his friends about it that he has blood
      related relatives that he doesn't want to go alone to meet with. Griffin
      goes with grey and grey meets his grand father and his entire family was
      nice and all. He for the first time felt like he was treated like a
      family. A few years more pass and the entire other insidents happend. At
      first grey didn't thought much of stephine but as times went by he started
      to notice his yearning for a attachment. Stephine wasn't something grey
      likes but her smile was like canser. It was ruining her but he was happy
      to see her smile. that's when he thought he'll break from the chains he
      bind himself with and now he'll investigate the case which he's been
      running away from. The answer was in front of his eyes this whole time.
      Maxin and Steven. They may not be the exact people grey is trying to find
      but investigationg their life may lead grey to what he's treying to find.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey returns to the current time. Grey thinks what has happend throw out
      his whole life. He wonderes how he ened up in a court trial but he doesn't
      cares. Austin reveals that grey is actually camilio's and griffin's son
      and the aligation that he's doing it all for the property he can just
      claim is illogical. Grey was afraid of his identity but not anymore.
      That's why he decided to help the police after so many years. They are
      close to the investigation and they think they can do it if they are given
      proper time. Austin manages to convince the trial to be on grey's side.
      Grey knew this would happend. The fact he confessed was cause he knew it
      would be perfectly ok to confess and then say that he confessed cause he
      was being hurt. It happens everytime so it's obious. Grey has returned to
      action. He'll find his parent's murderer.

      Grey told austin that he wishes to work with austin to find that guy.
      Apperently grey knows that it's either steven or that one guy that was
      camilio's ex who may have killed them. Grey asked austin that he seeks his
      help over this. Austin agrees but in one condition. Don't get too over
      yourself. This isn't a kids place but since grey is smart enough to
      understand that he'll work with him. Austin asks where they can find any
      information on steven or this mysterious grey is so fixed on. Grey
      explains that there are few guys grey himself conducted reacherch on. Even
      though he never wanted to run into such thing himself he himself tried to
      secretly doing so finding and found three names. But he somehow managed to
      narrow it down to one. And steven. Total two people that fall under this
      list. Who knows if that person is also hired by steven or something.
      They'll need to leave this town for now and visit a certain place. There
      were many missinformations about grey and other stuff. On the other side
      akio and others were planning to kill grey since he escaped or so. But why
      does he wants to kill grey. And akio explains that he got griffin's blood.
      He couldn't care less about anything about he won't forgive him ever. Grey
      got released today.
      <br />
      <br />
      They'll kill him soon enough. For starters they'll keep an eye on him.
      Akio get's a call and he's shocked. On the other side stephine woke up and
      she confronts her mother. Stephine hears everything but she doesn't want
      to believe that grey did any of that. Her mother tried to tell her that
      men are like that. They are cunning and doesn't have any emotions.
      Stephine's mother told stephine that she should stop thinking about grey.
      Stephine asked if her father came to see her but turns out there is not
      news about him. Stephine is sad and she askes for her phone and wants to
      call him. Her mother tried to stop her but she won't listen. Stephine
      calls steven but he doesn't picks up the call. Stephine's mother started
      creating a hassal in the hospital when the doctor came to take her mother
      out of there cause he can't let her mother cause any recless action
      leading her not to recover properly. Stephine was hurt by the talking of
      her mother saying that her father will never come back. He cut ties with
      them. She doens't want to believe. She remembers how people made fun about
      her father in class and she never took it likely and one day steven came.
      To see stephine. Steven had a good day with her but had to return to his
      place for something. For his busness. That day when stephine asked her
      mother she said steven didn't returned. Then after a few years when
      stephine was 16 or so her father visited home again. This time her parents
      were arguing and stephine called her mother a lier when she told her that
      her father never visited.
      <br />
      <br />
      Her father blammed her mother cause he visited every few year or so and
      even have eachothers contacts but she'll try her best to try stay away
      from steven and keep her from him. Stephine got real angry at her mother.
      Her mother tried to tell stephine that she doesn't want her daughter to
      get influinced by her father. Stephine didn't believed so and took her
      father's contacts. Stephine's father also reveals that he's been supplying
      money to the family all these years. She can't say that she doesn't want
      him while living under this house. If she really thinks that she wants to
      set apart steven will take stephine with him but she'll need to move out.
      Her mother refuses and steven leaves after calling her shameless. Stephine
      helps steven to return to airport. Steven asks stephine if she heard about
      someone named grey or so. She says that there is one boy. Steven reveals
      that he knows that boy since her parents were real good friends of him.
      And they were good friends. Even right now, all steven has achieved was
      cause of a massive help of grey's father. Stephine says that grey always
      seems like a fool. Steven says grey is a wolf in sheeps clothing. Stephine
      doesn't understand that. Steven says never mind. Stephine wishes steven a
      good travel and she wishes to stay at touch with her father and steven
      agrees.
      <br />
      <br />
      After that day stephine only got call from steven two times. Once to know
      if she has any relations or if her mother is still at the fight she's with
      steven. Stephine decided to call grey to know anything about him. She
      heard about grye being extreamly depressed by his friends. And in the end
      decided to take a meet up to apologise for everything she did but she
      truely needs grey. It's not the matter of love anymore. She desperetly
      needs grey to be full again. She feels like there is a whole in her heart.
      Griffin refused this idea along with arvin. He doesn't believes that
      stephine could be someone worth trusting. She'll betry grey the moment she
      can. Aria was there and she herself can say that inspite of being a good
      friend she can assure that she'll indeed do such thing. Stephine said that
      she thought that they were friends. Aria explained that friends mean they
      talk or like eachother for their personality. But that doesn't mean you
      are goanna pretend to be a good person when you aren't. Stephine after
      hearing this started crying and ali didn't likes where this was going so
      he suggested that she shouldn't take their words at hear. She can try
      talking to grey since if she really feels like grey is going to be someone
      she needs then maybe he'll understand her more than they may. Stephine
      thanks ali. Griffin was against this idea but ali insisted that this was
      the best way to resot this problem. After all this matter of relation is
      grye's not theirs.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ofcourse they'll have different openion. They shouldn't try to force their
      will on grey. Maybe he can see something in her that they can't see.
      Griffin was frustrated and decided to see it till the end but arvin left
      saying that he doesn't want to see her cause she was the reason grey got
      into so much truble recently. If she never came to grey's life then
      nothing like so would have happend. Ali told arvin not to act to childish
      but arvin won't listen. He left cause he doesn't want to know anything
      about her. Aria decided to leave as well. Stephine truely felt alone and
      tried understanding herself that she's been unintentionally been
      decieveing everything. It's like a nature to her. She needs to get rid of
      this cause everyone is hating her for this. On top of that she caused such
      truble to grey. She doesn't want to admit it but she feels like dying
      right now. Stephine visits grey's house but it's wierd cause the whole
      house is being broken. The constructen workers told them that grey sold
      this house and left this country and returned to his home land where he
      grew up in. Griffin remembers that he grew up as an orphan in turki. A
      generous country filled with generous and nice people acording to grey.
      Stephine was surprised to know that grey was an orphan. Griffin explained
      that grey was originally from this country but then his parents died at
      that country causing him to grow up as an adult. Thy were clueless about
      everything and griffin thinks most probapally grey hired austin to
      continue the case himself. He probapally needs protection and secrecy too
      since he used to be griffin's son.
      <br />
      <br />
      The information that griffin was grey's father confused stephine and she
      realized that her father took the company from grey's father when it
      should go to him due to inheretence. She felt bad for it. On the other
      side something wierd happend. A person came with lugage. It was her
      father. On the other side it was revealed that the person who came to
      inform akio was actually telling him about steven returning cause they
      didn't expected him to actually return to see his own daughter since it's
      not his type of work. Is he pretending to be something he isn't. Akio
      orders to kidnap steven's daughter. On the otherside stephine's mother
      wasn't too happy to see his face but she had to accept him cause she's
      tired of everything. Steven was angry but he said he wants to resort
      things up for their daughter. Stephine was on her phone and reaolized that
      no one in the world knows about steven coming to see his own daughter even
      though no one knows he has one. Steven said that he never reveald it cause
      he has enimies and doesn't want the entire world to know about her. Steven
      went to the kitchen and used a knife to do something. She doesn't bother
      about it much and she is happy cause her father has returned. Stepghine
      had alis number. Ali called stephine. On the other side grey was walking
      in a broken place. Austin asked if this building broke down a few years
      ago. Grey told austin that steven doesn't seem like a bad person from
      front. Austin says that looks can be decieveing.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey explains that nothing in the world seems as it is. Maybe they are on
      the wrong trac to think that following steven could help them. Grey thinks
      that the person who is responcible for everything is actually steven's
      enime. Not his underling or something. On the other side it's night.
      Stephine was talking to ali and ali told stephine that rumours about
      steven isn't good and she should be careful. Cause he doesn't has a good
      feeling for her father cause why didn't he resorted to protection for her
      when they had the chance. Stephine explained that they didn't knew about
      it much before. It was just a theory of grey that they followed. Ali said
      that even though it was a theory of him, offical police agreed with him.
      That basically means true. Stephine doesn't agrees with ali but still
      talks to him cause he doesn't treat her like a lier or something. Ali
      thought that this girl's play girl side is getting activated. Better stop
      right now. On the other side stephine's mother wasn't too happy about
      steven but still decided to heat the milk for steven. But there was a
      explotion that caught the house. Stephine's mother screamed. It caught ail
      and stephine's attention. Steven went to see what happend and turned out
      stephine's mother was burning. Steven couldn't risk his life for her but
      stephine was willing to do it but steven stopped her at the right time. It
      caused a massive heat in the neighbour hood. Stephine was really sad for
      everything. Ali came to calm her and she couldn't stop crying. Steven took
      care of the police. It seems like an accident. It was too. Seems like the
      table for the gas was too close to the wall creating a bend and then
      leaking it out causing a massive fire. The police checked everything and
      even post mortom report came. There is nothing can be done for now. It was
      a bad insident.
      <br />
      <br />
      The fact steven was there was kept secret cause he doesn't want to appear
      at news paper. He even paid for it specifecely. Ali consoled stephine
      specifely is when they both saw grey walkiing in the streeth and stephine
      ran towards him cause she realized that she never hated her mother but
      always misunderstood her cause of her emotions and she needs grey. Grey
      created an amazing escape when she tried to stop him. And grey explains
      that he doesn't need anybody right now. Stephine needs to take care of
      herlf if she really believes that grey is the one she wants. She was
      broken. steven saw it and told stephine that if she wishes that grey is
      someone she likes then she should go for it but steven doesn't recomend
      him after that stunt he pulled. Is he crazy. Stephine explains that that
      was wierd. There are still sides of him that she hasn't seen. She doesn't
      know what to do at this point since things are falling apart. She doesn't
      understand her own feelings. Steven told stephine that she should sleep or
      at least lay down on bed and think clearly since it's her age when she is
      having doubts. She is old enough to udnerstand the difference between
      right and wrong. She doesn't need to make the most accurate choise but she
      should make the best choice. At least somehting she wouldn't regret.
      Steven then asked her to ask question to herself saying if she wants grey
      or not. Stephine thinks for a while and steven tells stephine to take her
      time to figure it out but stephine instantly answers that she wishes to
      meet grey again and ask he himself some questions.

      After hearing this steven said that he heard what kind of insident happend
      and he thinks that stephine should stay safe. And specially he heard that
      grey hired a police man to solve a case. Stephine was told not to involbe
      heself into those short of matters since it's dangereous. Other than that
      steven wishes her a happy life. On the other side ali was eating ice
      cream. Seems like steven left to the country he came from to make
      buisness. Stephine was feeling real good cause she always feels like her
      burdens are releaved by her. While talking she reveals that there once was
      an insident when stephine's mother dropped a plate and they started
      quarell but steven stopped when stephine tried to stop them. Steven alwasy
      cared for her. Ali straight forward said to her ears that seems like it's
      manupulation. Stephine didn't liked that and shouted at ali for assuming
      such thing about her father. Ali apologizes. He then went to stephine's
      house and figured out that it's true that the pipes cut could really be
      from table bending but why did this knife specificly caught on fire. Was
      it used to cut the pipes. Stephine said that it was just too close to the
      fire. Maybe it was something her mother was holding. It sounds wierd to
      ali. He wonderes if steven killed her and stephine was sad cause ali
      thought bad about her father like everyone else. Ali told stephine to
      think it carefully cause they are dealing with the world.
      <br />
      <br />
      The world isn't too peaceful. There are people who are sceaming and
      playing their game. Steven is a buisness man. He very well could be doing
      somehting. It's impossible to think that he's simple cause ther wouldn't
      be possible. He wouldn't be a buisnessman then. Stephine thought for a
      while but didn't wanted to believe such thing. THat's when Ali told her to
      think it for one second. Just one second. Think who steven really is. Is
      he really the person he tends to show. Is he really not telling everything
      truth or everything is lie. She won't be told if she was lied to or not.
      It's something she needs to figure out herself if she wishes to grow. Or
      she can stay her father's whenver used puppet who appears whenever he
      wants and dissepares whenver he wants. He could verywell be a imposter.
      Stephine thought for a while and forsed herself but she doesn't want to.
      Ali put his hands on her shoulders and tried telling her that it's just a
      theory. No need to overthink. It's not like he's trying to imply something
      in her believes without her will. He knows that he can never do such
      thing. Ali realized that even though he's trying to tell and understand
      stephine the reality of this place she isn't listening. So ali at last
      tells stephine to at least be aware of what is happening cause she needs
      to be causious. Even though she refuses to believe such thing at least she
      can try figuring out what happend to her mother. Ali and stephine started
      their investigation. For starters they started asking their neighbours if
      they know anything and while doing so stephine tells ali about how her
      situation with steven was.
      <br />
      <br />
      While visiting their neighbours they meet an aunty type person who tells
      stephine to visit a guy who may know about steven or at least her mother
      cause they were old time friends. She heard about him from stephine's
      mother. And among those names one was him. She believes that he may know
      the most about steven in her opinion. Ali goes with the info they
      recieved. It wasn't much but sure was enough. They went to meet up that
      guy that aunt menthoined and they expected him to be super wealthy but he
      was a normal looking guy with family. But sure looked scary or something
      like that. Ali and stephine wondered how to ask questions and stephine
      menthoined that she wanted to know about her father since he's always so
      far away. "So he killed his own wife this time? Sure isn't surprising to
      hear." Stephine was surprised to hear that. Ali asked if he's implying
      that steven could be the person who killed stephines mother. That man
      explained that steven came back for his family after years which he didn't
      even cared for and suddenly out of no where his wife died but his daughter
      is completely fine. To be honest he didn't thought steven even had a
      daughter but after hearing such news he was sure that stephine was being
      brain washed by him. He then glared at stephine and told her that steven
      can go as far as he can for money, wealth and fame.
      <br />
      <br />
      Heck he even killed his own friend and boss. Griffin. Stephine asked why
      he thinks such thing. That guy then explined to stephine that steven isn't
      as he seems. Life isn't a game where it'll be subbtitle. People will lie
      and they have to figure that lie out for themselves. Steven was always
      envios of his sorrunding. Specially griffin. He did not only spread
      rumours about him but also played a part in a project with griffin and
      intentionally created a mess just to make fool out of griffin. And how did
      he do it? He made griffin blame him. He intionally created a situation
      where griffin blamed him for something which he took chance to act
      vaunerable and show everyone that he's unreasonable. Preety shameless. Of
      course no one believed griffin even though everyone in mind knew something
      was off but just cause steven exicuted the situation so good that no one
      had a quetstion against him. That's just the short of reputation he had
      held for so long. No one was surprised when steven stole the entire family
      busness of griffin. Not even his adopted son grey got anything. Stephine
      was surprised to hear that. She didn't knew grey was adopted. Ali asked
      him that they are trying to find who killed stephine's mother cause one
      thing for certain that it wasn't just an accident. The most probapall
      answer is steven but they have no proff. That guy explained that he has no
      way of figuring anything cause he's just an ordinery person who isn't any
      detective. But he can say one thing for sure and that's he had slept with
      many people and left them after that.
      <br />
      <br />
      Among them were stephine's mother. He didn't expected her to keep the baby
      cause he himself once heard a news of steven by forse got one of his gf
      abortion. This surprised stephine and he then told stephine that she's
      luky to be alive cause her mother was just another list in steven's harem
      list. There is nothing she can do to deny that unless he's lying which
      even stephine can figure out that he isn't lying. Stephine started crying
      this stroke that guy. So he came and tried comforting stpehine and told
      her that many cried cause of steven. Some mental and some physically. This
      reminded that guy when steven got into a fight with him cause he refuses
      to do anything for him. Even though they were friends. That guy then gives
      some adresses and tells stephine that she should meet those people
      specially a guy who almost died cause of steven. Stephine was preety heart
      broken after this. She can't imagine steven having such side. She wanted
      to call steven but ali stopped her. They got into fight and ali told her
      that she can't be foolish. If he knew tha they are suspecting things then
      they won't learn anything and if he's really what she suspects then they
      could be in danger. Stephin adds logic that if he isn't then they'll be
      fine, won't they? Ali explains that if he really is innocent then thye'll
      learn in throw evidence. Not throw some random guy's opinion.
      <br />
      <br />
      So she should wait. Have some paitence if she truely wishes to have a
      happy life. She started crying again. Ali thought bad for stephine so he
      tried comforting her but a hand came from behind told not to make little
      girl cry. It was alex. Ali was surprised. He asked who he is and alex
      revelas that he's in charge of current investigaiton of robert's death who
      is their formal friend or at least that's what he thought. Alex came here
      to meet stephine cause he knows the connectiong betten her stalking and
      robert's death or is trying to figure out and so he came directly to her
      to see the truthness of his info that other people collected throw out
      this case. She basically gave alex a testimony and alex was surprised to
      see that the testimony matches the old record. So the info was true.
      Stephine asks alex about grey and alex tells stephine everything about
      grye. He dissepeared after that court day and he was smiling for some
      reason. Alex knew the moment he saw those smiles that he knows someting.
      He figured something out. Seems like someone is getting betrayed. But it
      doesn't matter. Alex came here to investigate stephine's mother's death.
      <br />
      <br />
      He doesn't believes that it was just an accident and he even checked her
      house. Stephine asks when and alex explains that he came there to check a
      whiele back ago when the case ended. He was quite suprised to know even
      stephine didn't kenw alex. Ali asks alex why he didn't just took over the
      case the moment he figured that it was a murder. Alex tells ali that is he
      stupid or something. Why would he do that? When someone else is working
      hard for gathering evidence and info then why will he waste time and
      energy on that himself. All he needs to do for now is connect the dots. On
      top of that it's greater merit to solve a closed case. Matter of fact he
      wasn't even in charge of this case. He was actually doing another case
      where a mother died with a child and the child survibed. Alex decided to
      let things a little space and have paitence and realized that robert's
      case had a really good connection with both case cause both murders
      happend at the same day. So he observed grye and everything related to
      that. He has to say that grey was very much lucky at this point. He'll
      give that to him. Ali asks the name of the woman who got into accident and
      it wasn't in the list ali got from that man and he total has five names
      and plases to visit. Alex realized that that list could be handy. He
      quickly made a copy of that. Stephine asked what made him think robert's
      case is connected to theirs. Alex explains that the daughter was sent to
      orphanage inspite of her vast property and a few days ago she was taken
      back to home by her home worker. Later alex went to the house since he
      figured something was fishy with it. He only specteted things until then
      but he could smell truble and he was right. The house keeper who took her
      back ran away.
      <br />
      <br />
      Alex believes that she was planned to be killed but it failed cause of
      alex kept an eye on her and on top of that alex believes that she is
      stephine's sister. This surprised both ali and stephine. Alex explained to
      stephine that when he investigated this case he found no evidence of
      murder but only one thing he found as supecious that it was that there was
      one entry in a school was steven's name. Of course steven is a really
      common name so alex went to check if it was the steven guy from who own a
      company as the ceo and turned out to be true. Steven isn't that famous yet
      he's very secretive of his intentiy and even pays news papers for his own
      news to be put down. He has control and he even closed the case of
      stephine's mother's case in saying that it was an accident and it's futile
      to give stephine mental pressure from all the questoning which in theory
      isn't a bad cause but the fact that he's supposidely the main suspect of
      the case makes things a lot complicated. But inspite of everything alex
      needs stephine's hair cause he wants to do a dna test of course he also
      needs stephine's permission for it. Stephine allows it but she was
      extreamly shocked to think everything and she asked to meet the girl and
      alex explained that he was just going to meet her anyways but he figured
      that meeting stephine would shorten things up cause it'll help him to
      untie two sisters together. Stephine made up her mind and got strong to
      meet her sister and wondered what she has for store. She surely has
      started to doubt things now. They walk to the house where stephine is
      supposed to meet her younger sister but they didn't expected the house to
      be this fancy. They get inside the house and see a girl in wheel chair
      wait for them. She has a massive scar on her head. She got rich from her
      grandpa not from her mother or father.
      <br />
      <br />
      They didn't recieved anything until they found out she actually had this
      much wealth. Alex is responcible for such thing cause he figured that this
      could have gone to the wrong hands. He has no connection for now but if
      the dna test comes out to be true then there is a possiblity that steven
      was goanna take everything from this child. After talking to the little
      girl stephine realized that she was brainwashed just like her and it made
      her cry. Stephine's sister whom we can call for now nola tells stephine
      that he wants to know about her fahter cause he barely spended time with
      her. That day her mother was talking bad with her father and while so the
      car suddenly hit the side causing the accident. Her mother was confused
      since the brakes failed. Stephine started crying and told nola that she
      shouldn't belive anymore since no one will come for her. It was all lies
      that should believe right now. She can't be blinded by the lies. Both
      sisters started crying. She was confused. She explains that she is right
      now waiting for austin who was supposed to take her to orphanage or
      something. Alex explains that austin was here before and even grey. This
      info shocks stephine. Alex explains that austin took quite a pity on nola
      and wished to raise her himself. Ali asks what they were doing and alex
      just dropped a call asking if they want to talk to him and ali says yes.
      He very much wants to do. But when they were about to hand up the walki
      talki the bell rang.

    <h2>Arc 9- The right hand man and Austin.</h2>
    <p>
      <br />
      <br />
      A npc looking police helper went to see who rang the bell and he got shot
      dead. Everyone quickly got alert. Suddenly gun shot started from the front
      door and it was so sudden that they were confused and couldn't think
      properly. They'll jumped for shelter from the gunshot and firing. Stephine
      jumped to save her sister while alex helped ali to survibe some gun shots.
      Alex realized that someone was coming from the front door so he brought
      out his gun and told ali to take stephine out from the back door and even
      though ali didn't wanted to do so and stay alongside alex but he knew it
      wasn't his place to do so. So he decided to follow orders and took
      stephine and nola out to the back door from the kitchen. Alex holded off
      the person who was coming from the front door. He was going for the gun
      shot. He started firing and decided not to waste too much bullets since he
      doens't have enough if multiple people are there. He should have came here
      with a team. On the other side akio's right hand man who was coming from
      the front door stopped and realized that steven's daughter fleed from the
      back door and decided to leave this place to his three ghouns. On the
      other side when ali opend the back door from the kitchen he noticed that
      four people were standing there with guns and so. Ali was scared but
      realized that he has no option so he makes a run and tried pushing that
      guy enough for stephine to run with her sister which both of them make a
      run for it when ali shoults them to flee. The other three decided to go
      after stephine but the guy who was being held by ali decided to play with
      him when he picked up a broom and decided to use that to fight. On this
      side alex figured that those two people were super easy to capture so he
      did.
      <br />
      <br />
      Handcufed them and called for back up. He left them and decided to rush
      for ali and stephine. On this side of ali he managed to make a dent to the
      guy who was fighting him off and alex came right in time for the capture.
      Both of them rush for stephine. On this side stephine was being chased by
      three men. Ali picked a better pipe to attack those three while alex saw
      the akio's right hand man and decided to capture him insted. Ali rushed to
      fight with those three alone cause he sweared to protect stephine and her
      sister. A attack came and ali tried to block those with his pipe but it
      bended quickly causing him to get hit on the head. They thought he was a
      goner until he came back and blowed the life out of the guy who hit him
      with pipe. Ali was full beast mode and even took out another guy but he
      was still awake. When he tried to rush to hit him that other guy hit him
      with a bullet cause they had gun. They thought that it was shocking how
      long they had guns but couldn't use it. Ali didn't died cause it only hit
      his arms. That guy then shot at ali's leg. Seems like he can't walk for a
      while now. Stephine found no way and decided to make a run for it. It
      caught both of their reactions so both stalkers tried chasing stephine. On
      the other side alex found a lot of enmies cause he layed directly on their
      territory. They all openly fired at alex when he decided to hide and alex
      was asking for backup and figured that they are opnely firing at him cause
      they are so big in number. That means they won't dogh even if someone
      get's shot. Alex shot a cuple of guns at some of them and it shocked them
      and they kept firing. Eventually their number shortened.
      <br />
      <br />
      So even they decided to hide. Alex was causus of their gun shot. He knew
      which people had had how many gun shot and decided to use that time period
      when they figure out that they ran out of bullet to strike and he took
      quite a few and he knew that he can't take all of them out cause he's
      bound to get shot. As expected someone caught alex off guard and pointed a
      gun at him but alexe's bacup came. It was late but at the right time. The
      both teams started firing and alex went for akio's guy but figured that he
      ran away. On this side stephine was running but then he saw some men and
      decided to stop running. The two guys from behind came and acught
      stephine. Stephine asked for help from those people and those people stood
      brave and helped stephine from those two cause they were four in numbers.
      Stephine thanked them and they told her to be safe but one of their skull
      got blown up by akio's guy. He said that his men were worthless. It was
      too kind of him to supply them of guns but those idiots doesn't even know
      how to use it properly. Not cause their aim is so bad. It's cause they are
      not used to guns and waste a lot of amo hitting nothing. Preety wasteful
      for them to play with gun. He decided to kidnap stephine but from behind
      came ali crawling. He holded his legs and told him that he can't let him
      take her. But he got stomped and couldn't save both of them.
      <br />
      <br />
      This made stephine's sister cry and akios guy asked stephine if she'll
      willingly go with him or be dragged down. And she prefered the first
      option. By the time alex came to rescue it was too late. Akio's guy
      already left. Alex told ali that he fought well for who he was and told
      all his subordinates to seal the area. They won't let a single person
      leave this city. He needs cctv footage of the entire area. Contact control
      room right now. A few hours later arvin rushed to hospital to see ali and
      griffin was right beside him. Ali had his hand and leg bandaged. Arvin was
      worried about ali and heard what happend. Aria also came to meet. She hear
      what happend to stephine and ali explained that things are not in their
      hands. It's like a storm where they can't do anything. They can't handel
      this massive problem. Griffin agrees and aria feels hopeless. Arvin
      doesn't want to believe that. Griffin tells arvin that they are not
      heroes. They can't think of catching real life criminals that they are
      being hunted by. Arvin asks why grey can then? he's clearly working with a
      police. Griffin says it's cause he's luky while ali says it's cause he's
      smart. Griffin says that he can accept the fact that grey has some level
      of help that he provided and it seems as if he's so close to everything
      but they can't forget that kevin also found out who the killer was and
      really close but lost casuse he lacked power which grey doesn't cause he
      has austin and other police to help him. Ali asks why isn't he showing
      himself then?
      <br />
      <br />
      Wouldn't it be better to lure then out? Arvin explains that it won't be an
      option cause he'll just die. It's like they are in a huge box with a lot
      of stuff where poison cal slip throw and kill you when you don't even
      understand how it came here in the first place. He can't affort to loose
      his life. Not cause the investigation will stop in any ways. Matter of
      fact grey's death will only prove more value to the investigation and will
      lead closer to the killer but it's just not worth it. It's not like
      finding the killer is the end goal. Remember, grey never wanted revenge at
      the first place cause he wanted to live a life alone cause he feared that
      someone will kill him but he recently got his mental support from
      stephine. It wasn't from any of them. It was stephine who made grey
      realize how lonely he really was until he felt like he can give up
      everything to achieve that live free life. Aria asks what will they do
      then? Grey managed to find a way to help his way out then why can't they?
      Griffin- nothing is coming to mind. Then they got a sudden news on tv.
      That surprised all of them. Steven has a secretery. He was talking to
      someone in phone and steven asked him to come in and asked him whom he was
      talking to and he said it was a family member. Steven then asked to start
      talking about the thing but that's when he get's a video messege. He
      decided to play it while that man is standing and it turned out to be a
      threat.
      <br />
      <br />
      It's akio's guy and he reaveals that he got both his daughters and wants 1
      M before this night and if not then his daughter's will die including his
      history of having multiple relations is already out to the public. This
      surprised him. On the other side griffin, ali and arvin with aria were
      shocked to find the news that they recieved the same news as steven did.
      Every girl steven slept with. Steven's daughteres are kidnapped and he
      want's money. Alex saw the news and decided to contact steven. steven
      finding no option decided to elaborate but he found that the police are
      trying to call steven. Steven then heard the next part of the messege. He
      was told not to contact police cause they'll be killed. Steven cut the
      call. He ordered to prepare the money. On this side griffin wondered if
      steven was actually a bad guy cause they wouldn't do such thing if steven
      was really with them. They would just kill his daughter. Arvin wondered
      and said that no. They have the chance to kill her right now but they
      seems to have missjudged steven cause of his way of playing. Maybe he
      wasn't a good husband or person even. But he can't be the killer. On this
      side steven's legal advicer tried stopping him but steven explains that he
      can't right now. He may have been missloyal in the past but he can't
      accept his daughters being in such hands. He needs to do whatever it needs
      to protect them. He thinks how he started relations when his wife would
      keep them apart so he tried getting unfaithful causing such event. He
      won't be able to forgive him if something happend to nola or stephine.
      Aria was worried about stephine.
      <br />

      Ali blammed himself for not being able to stop anything when he was right
      there standing. Arvin told ali that at least he tried to do his best. He
      can't just overcome bullets. He's not a wizerd or anything. Ali explains
      that no, he should have been able to dogh the bullets. Those guys's aims
      were not good but not bad euither. They were shooting randomly and ali
      should have been able to react before they shot the gun. But he failed. He
      failed to take advantage of his opponent's weekness. On a different side
      stephine was watching everything throw a tv they got. Seems like steven
      agreed to co operate. She was convinced that she missunderstood steven and
      tried apologising it to herself. She held nola close to her acuse she
      can't let her anything happening to her. One of them were told to search
      for tracking devices on their cloths and they insted of searching for
      anything decided to rip apart stephine's cloths. then burned them.
      Stephine was facing shame. Then they proceded to do the same with her
      sister. Stephine tried stopping them cause she was just a child but they
      didn't stop. They left nothing behind. Then they burned the cloths. Nola
      was crying and stephine tried calming her saying everything will be
      alright. But it felt annoying to akio's guy so he kicked stephines face
      and let her fall on the ground and decided to go to a different room to
      talk to akio or do whatever he wants. Steven sent the money to the desired
      place. Akio's guy called akio to know if the money came and akio told his
      man to kill the kids cause the money came succesfully. Akio's guy procided
      to kill both of them. So he ordered one of his men to finish both girl and
      that man went on his way to do so but then akio heard a noice. It was
      cars.
      <br />
      <br />
      Police cars. They are being invaided. On this side when that guy told that
      they are ordered to kill stephine and everything they decided to do it
      quickly and both sisters started crying. that's when a can was thrown at
      that place. It was a smoke screen. A few smoke balls and others. Akio's
      guy was busy escaping throw a different route while taking some stuff with
      him. A lot of sleeping gas and smoke powers made their way in whie a few
      10s of people were standing there confused. Stephine took nola with her
      even thought they had no cloths. They started running cause they have
      nothing to do better. A guy chases her. It was the same guy who hit ali
      with a rod. He chases both sisters but turned out that guy almost killed
      stephine by landing a rod hit on her but screen got cut. The police are
      firing guns and catching people. Sam was between the police capturing
      people. He had quite the edge. On the other side austin found akio. Akio
      asked how they found this place and austin says that they know every
      entrence of this place. Thanks to grey. On this side the swinging rod
      comes but grey was the one who saved stephine. He threw that guy off and
      looked at stephine and asked why she was naked. On this side austin fights
      with guns with akio's guy. Then they go hand to hand and looses but
      managed to survibe.
      <br />
      <br />
      then he almost got a gun shot but then the scean ends with austin under a
      gun. A firing sound was heard. On this place grey gave some cloths for
      both of them to wear. On a different side alex comes at the right time. He
      tells sam to investigate further since there is only few of them left. Sam
      makes his way to meet austin cause he wants to learn more and wonder why
      austin took grey's orders. What's so special about grey which makes him a
      better investigator than him. He wants to be better. He eventually finds
      grey. Grey hands stephine to sam and tells him to take her to safety while
      he has some work to do. Sam accepts it anyways and wonderes if it's
      responcibility. That's which grey has which he lacks. Grey is a
      responcible person who is reliable for almost everything. Is that one of
      the reasons he's better than him even though their age difference. Maybe
      experince will make him harder. Grey makes his way to the killer while sam
      takes stephine to the shelter. The police are having some truble capturing
      those guys but they are almost done. Alex gives out order seeing sam and
      decided to rush to the real fight. Grey walks the road thinking everything
      has happend. He was with austin and grey decided to hire austin cause
      that's how'll he'll be involbed into this case even though he's an
      outsider.
      <br />
      <br />
      Austin asks grey about his thoughts and grey says there is someone grey
      fears the real deal may be. He needs info. This mean time austin is seen
      where is fails to protect griffin and also was sad that he wasn't smart
      enough to solve the case. Or he still has clues out there but he's unfit
      to be an investigator. He retires cause it caused a huge harm to austin's
      honour. Then the day comes when grey called austin about the case. Grey
      told austin about the case going to end which could be his last chance to
      solve something he failed to do. Austin asks why grey is inspiring him
      even though he decided to stay nutrual. Grey explains that he is just
      afraid of his situation and being invobled into stuff. Sometimes he get's
      inside stuff without realizing. Maybe something inside him still wants the
      justice he deserved. Or plain curiocity. Austin got motivated by grey and
      got into the case. While austin was thinking so much grey figures out some
      stuff. He asks for austin's network of intellegence to search for this
      face. Grey then reaches a certain shop and asks if that person came there
      a certain time period ago and that person replies saying that he doesn't
      knows but could be. Cctv doesn't record that long. But his face is sure
      familier. Austin was surprised by everything. He said that we solved the
      case didn't we. Grey you did it. Grey explains that he did nothing. Matter
      of fact his intuation could very well be false. They need confermation.
      Austin thought that he thought that he knew everything about griffin but
      this much about his was unrevealed to him.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey was looking at a list short. Austin asks what to do now. They know
      the identity of the killer but it won't help them in any way. Or maybe
      it'll but what can they do for now? They don't know the location or
      anything. And as grey said they don't have confermation. Grey explains
      that there is actually anothe man sitting behind the killer. Austin asks
      so the real killer isn't the mastermind? Grey says that it's just a theory
      but whatever. They need to visit another place. Grey and austin go to
      visit stephine's sister. Grey instandly became nola'a favoirite. On the
      other hand austin was furious and wondered what to do and grey decided to
      call steven and he talked to him. Steven said nothing and said that he did
      had multiple relations but what are they goanna do about it. It's not
      illigal. Austin asks what would he do to nola and steven explains that he
      didn't wanted her to give birth to her but since she's born. He can't
      ignore the fact she's her daughter. He's coming there a week or so. He
      asks austin to take care for her until then. Austin was raged and asks
      what'll he do if he refused and decided to take her under him. Steven says
      he'll be more than happy to have that cause that'll save him a lot of
      truble cause he's not a good father. Austin was so mad that he decided to
      so. He'll take care of nola himself and make sure she's raised well. Not
      like steven who won't even notice her. Steven tells austin that seems like
      he'll need to cancle his flight. Austin cuts the call. Grey looks at
      austin with a wierd look.
      <br />
      <br />
      He asked austin that he asked him no questions that could figure them out
      if he was the killer or not. Austin thought and said that they should call
      him again. Grey explains that it'll worsen things up cause he will realize
      that they are not sure of anything. When asking questions he needs to let
      him know that they know what he has done for him to confess. Otherwise
      they don't have proff no matter how much they theorise. The max they can
      do is a 6 months court case but after that it'll end cause they have no
      evidence. Thats how people like him survibe. Austin asks if grey suspects
      steven to be the mastermind behind all this and grey says that he isn't
      sure. He can't give a clear answer but for what they learned at least till
      now indicates that steven may not be the worse person they met but that
      guy definetely isn't worth loving. But then again, he can't do anything or
      will if another girl hooked up to him and got scammed. Austin felt real
      bad and decided to take care of nola. She was confused and wonderer if
      that means she'll go back to the orphanage. Austin explains that he
      doesn't care if steven is good or bad. At least he isn't forgiving him.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey wonders what gives people like them motivation to feel irritated when
      it's not even their place. Mybe they don't lack much emotion that grey
      does. Maybe that's the difference he shares with normal people. He lacks
      humanity. Or it could be that his gen z blood is getting activated for him
      to care anything else than trying to act cool even though he isn't or at
      least he thinks so. Then austin got a call from alex and he's coming there
      with stephine and ali. Grey didn't expected that. It's bad cause he isn't
      able to think of such possiblities. Austin hits on grey's head and tells
      him not to play detective cause he won't really be doing anything like
      this after this case is solved or at least he hopes it get's solved. Grey
      agrees. Austin says that or grey could actually be a detective after this
      or while at it. Grey tells austin that they'll need to leave. Austin asks
      why grey doesn't want to stay and grey tells austin that they need to give
      stephine room for growth that there is a possiblity that she won't recieve
      if grey stays there. Austin didn't understood that and decided to stay
      connected to alex's walki talki. Then stephine entered the room and grey
      and austin was hearing them from a far while drinking cofee. Stephine
      bursted into tears and it all made sence. Austin after hearing what
      stephine had to say said to grey that he may become a great father if he
      ever did became one. Grey said that austin could be wrong though.
      <br />
      <br />
      I mean it's not gurenteed that your actions will affect someone good or in
      a bad way. Situations like those are tricky which is something grey
      doesn't want to face. Never. He doesn't even know if he grows up to be man
      he'll be able to make his family happy. Austin thought grey would say
      protect. Grey said that even if he protected his family from outside
      threats but then who will protect them from him? Austin asks if griffin
      was violent with him. Grey explained that he felt nothing when his parents
      died. Nothing major when his mother died, nothing majour when his father
      died but it did create an impact on his. But he did care for it when his
      brother got killed. A radmoe girl got killed cause of him. They didn't
      deserved it. When grey's grandpa died grey just figured that people dying
      was normal. They suddenly dissepear from existence. But when he saw his
      brother laying dead. It made something inside of him go hollow. To him
      they were outsiders. He was outsiders. Griffin tend to raise grey cause he
      was after the proterty which was left behind by his grandfather. Austin
      then told grey something. That grey has forgotten some amount of his past
      and filled it with his imagination cause of his emotions. Grey realized
      something. Grey realized something. He told austin that he's a genius to
      even understand what happend. Austin was confused. Grey explains that it
      all makes sence now. Grey always wondered what about his past didn't made
      sence.
      <br />
      <br />
      It was cause of his emotions. Griffin didn't always treated him of an
      outsider. Camilio didn't always treated him as an outsiderer rather he
      treated himself as an outsider and those emotions made him persive reality
      throw a differnt way of thnking. That explains the answer grey was
      searching for. If he still cared for his late parents. He was so young
      that he filled real life events with his imagination of how people treated
      him even though it wasn't how it was to begin with. Just cause some
      instences. He's a fool. Austin saw grey sitting with regrets and wondered
      and said that everyone has regrets. Most of the times it's just some
      misunderstanding. Maybe some simple words can fix this. Glad to help you
      understand yourself better. grey. Then we can see grey running. Grey
      remembered how they saw stephine getting attacked but they decided to
      spectate things insted of going down cause it'll take longer to reach
      there than observe going to just the roof of some building. They do as
      they decided and saw the events. Austin points the gun when he saw akio's
      guy on his hands on stephine and her sister. Grey told austin to point
      down the gun. He can't affort to miss shot right now. Austin holds his gun
      off cause it's unrealestic to think they can shot from this far. Grey then
      fired a drone there. Austin asks what that was and grey explained that it
      was a drone that he bought or you can say self made with some wierd
      things. It can shoot videos and track only. Grey shot a tracking device on
      stephine's hair and figured that it was the safest place.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine noticed the tracker but insted decided to keep it cause she
      realized that it was something important. Then when she got the time she
      inserted the thing to her sister's hairs. Grey saw it all throw the drone.
      Austin said that now they can attack on their stronghold. Grey says that
      they can't waste a single moment or even risk stephine's life cause
      they'll be killing her any moment now. Austin asks why and grey says that
      it's all steven's plan. He's doing politics again. They realized the
      location and grey found the news online and figured that so this is the
      way he decided to play things up. Austin asks if he really is behind all
      this then why is he exposing himself. Grey tells austin that it's like
      he's doing it on purpose. The moment he'll transfer the money it'll be
      like an order that you are paid now. Do your job of killing. No one would
      suspect and rather think steven lost a portion of his money. He wasn't a
      loyal husband but was a good person which is the biggest lie. They reach a
      certain place where there were a lot of paint balls. Austin says that no
      official police officer would be certified to use this in a official
      mission. Grey says that even tought it's the best thing to do. Then they
      started the operation and at present grey grabbed a iron bar from the side
      and reached akio's guy where sam also reached throw a different route.
      They both saw the death bodied of austin. He died. Both grey and sam got
      mad and decided to fight that guy.
      <br />
      <br />
      But turned out that both of them were preety weak to fight with that guy
      but grey managed to hit some combos but even that guy managed to escape
      cause grey and sam were severly injured and alex was the one chasing
      akio's guy while grey rested. that guy somehow managed to escape. That guy
      figured that grey and sam were only buying time since both of them were
      inexperienced and were waiting for backup for the real deals to show up. A
      day passed by and grey was at the hospital. He saw stephine with a
      terrible mental state. And her sister couldn't stand at all even though
      she was doing better. Her state has gone worse. Grey wanted to talk to her
      but thought that it'd be better not to. After all, he's a nobody to her
      right now. Maybe only thing he'll do is worsen things up. The dna test
      results came out and it was true. Both of them are related. Acording to
      alex steven is coming to see his daughters after making time. Grey says
      that he won't be coming here until next month cause he knows stephine is
      ok which is the biggest hassel to him. Stephine was walking there and
      heard that. She saw grey. Grey asks where stephine will go after this and
      ali was there. He tells that it would be police obserbation cause they'll
      need to protect her along with check on her mental state. Grey says that
      it'll be bad for her health and they shouldn't sent her to litteleral jail
      for that. Grey thinks that there is something he can do that would make
      sure that both sisters are safe. From behind stephine came and grey heard
      that. He didn't wanted to face stephine right now and wanted to run away
      but stephine caught him and she started crying.
      <br />
      <br />
      She said it was all grey's fault. Nothing like those would have happend if
      he was there. Ali and alex watches that. Stephine tells greay that he's
      really angry at him. Grey tried stopping her and hugged her. He apologised
      for causing this much truble to her. This side nola was watching austin's
      death body. She was sad and sam was holding her. Sam tells her that she
      won't need to worry cause austin just got a little injured. He's sleeping.
      Maybe he'll wake up the next day. Doctor told them not to disturb them.
      Nola says that bed must be uncomfortable. How's he sleeping there. Sam
      tried playing dum and got out of there and thought that she is a kid but
      isn't dum like how kids originally used to be. That's a pain. In a
      different side aria was sitting at her home with arvin and wondered if
      stephine was ok. Arvin told her that they don't know for sure. Things are
      too worrying. He wonderes what grey is doing. It didn't took them 3
      seconds to know. Grey, ali, stephine and nola all came to her house.
      Aria's father explains that stephine and her sister is going to live with
      them for a while. It's a croweded road with ton's of cctvs and a police
      stations right beside. No one can hope to attack. Grey previously asked
      for permisson from stephine's father and talked to ali about it. Both ali
      and alex sait that it's a good idea but also could be bad. Alex thought
      and said that it's not bad but it could be bad for aria or her parents.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey says that he needen't worry about her parents cause he has other
      plans. Acording to grey's plan this case will end this month. Arvin was so
      annoyed that he wanted to leave but when he was asked to have dinner with
      them he had no choise. Arvin saw grey and he had a lot of questions for
      him. For starters he asked grey where griffin is. Grey said that they
      forgot to invite him. Arvin asks grey how he got aria's father's number
      before him which was the same question aria had. Grey explained that about
      10 years ago or so he met aria's father with his father in a store. That
      was her father's store. Grey bought a smart watch from his store and took
      his number and saved it. He has a total of 300 different numbers for
      emergency or just his father's friends who calls him often. Both aria and
      arvin were surprised to hear that and thought that grey knew her father
      even before he knew her. That's crazy. Arvin said that he remembers grey
      being a millionair. Grey explains that he actually isn't millionair.
      Matter of fact he's was in a big loan when his father died. Arvin asks how
      can he spend so much money so frequently then. Grey says that he actually
      bought some shares, invested on stock market and other stuff to get the
      money he desires. Matter of fact griffin only left a huge loan of 1
      million for grey when he died before paying for their house loan. The
      house was taken back by the bank but grey managed to sweep stuff and now
      he owns a lot of money. He got his house back. Paied all the inrest which
      totals 3.5 million. This made everyone there surprised. Ali asks how much
      does his house even cost. Grey says that originally the house was supposed
      to cost only 20million with intrest but his father only paid 17 million.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey had to sell everything to lower the loan to 1 million. That means
      2million worth things sold. Then he used his laptop and got public
      internet from a cafe and after 10 years he's free. Bank loan is
      terrifying. Grey right now has nothing left. He was doing a course of 10
      years to pay his debt and he got fired recently when the robert thing
      started. He sold his house and the land including made him 40 million that
      he used to buy an aready build house in a decent place. Arvin asks why he
      even sold his house in the first place and grey explained that that house
      had memories that he likes but also used to gave him nightmares and
      doesn't want to live there anymore. The house was too big for him. Right
      now all grey has in the name of money is a million doller neckless he's
      wearing this wole time. Arvin asked why is he so care free about this.
      Grey explained that he can't just leave his neckless at home. On top of
      that his brother was the one who gave it to him. They were quite surprised
      and Both grey, ali and arvin left. Stephine was left alone and aria told
      stephine that she;s lucky for being able to be with grey cause arvin is
      just broke. Stephine was thinking something else. She said to aria that
      her father's company. It belongs to grey but he took it over when griffin
      died. Stephine wants to give it back to grey. Aria was confused and asked
      her how will she even acomplish somethig like that. Stephine explained
      that she doesn't knows but something needs to be done cause it doesn't
      belongs to him. It belongs to grey. Aria asks if she still believes that
      steven is not a criminal.
      <br />
      Stephine knows that steven said too many lies and she doesn't cares if he
      has done anything or not but she won't forgive him for lying. On this side
      arvin grey and ali met griffin. They all go meet in some short of roof
      top. Griffin heard grey's lies and told him that it was funny to hear that
      he bought another apartment when he just spend all his money so pay his
      loan. Arvin asks if grey wanted show off in front of stephine or
      something. Grey said that he didn't wanted to create a situation where
      they'll know that grey is homeless. Arvin explained that those guys didn't
      payed grey enough to pay the loan. So he sold the house itself to raise
      money. How much money does he have in pocket right now. Grey explains that
      he has nothing cause his father didn't paid anything. Grey couldn't save
      up anything and everything went into expences. Griffin told grey that he
      really thought that moving every furniture he had moving to his house
      would be a good idea. Ali and arvin were shcoked. So he didn't move his
      things to austin's houose. Grey explains that he in all those years at
      least made enough money to save up his things in house. Otherwise he would
      have to give up everything. Bank loan is too scary. Even though you are
      paying it, not paying it for a long time could cost you everything. Arvin
      asked why didn't his father paid it already when he could. Grey explained
      that some millionair idiots tend to take loans after loan and don't pay
      it. They insted take a bigger loan and don't pay the tax. But his father
      thought it would be a good idea to use his land and house as a certify
      when he should have given his shares that's worth something.
      <br />
      <br />
      Even if his shares went down it wouldn't mean anything cause when those
      shares were given to bank it had a certain value. Grey asked griffin if he
      could stay at his house and griffin said yes. Arvin and ali were sad. So
      it's debate time. Griffin thinks steven is not the killer or in any ways.
      Arvin and ali doesn't says so. They think he's the killer. He killed his
      both wives in a certain way. Griffin impies that it could be that the
      killer have some short of enimies with steven and is trying to eradicate
      his family in some format of revenge and recent act was such example. Ali
      and arvin says that it could be possible but.. Nothing is coming to mind.
      They all went throw a certain form of silence since nothing was coming to
      mind. Grey says that why would he kill camilio though? If he wanted
      griffin's life then why did he went after camilio's life. Nothing was
      written on her name. Matter of fact griffin left nothing on his own
      biological son's name. No one had any info on griffin's wife having any
      short of hand on griffin's property but insted she was killed after two
      years of griffin's death. On thing that comes to mind is that if they
      didn't killed her then it would have been better for the killer cause it
      would be implied that the target was griffin and his wealth but after
      killing camilio it was clear that someone is family enimy but why after
      two years? Was the killer hiding or trying to convince her that she has no
      worries. Griffin implies that it could be william since he proposed her
      during that period of time. Grey explains that he thought that himself but
      he knows for a fact that william is not the guy who did it. It was not
      steven.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey implies that it was ... A few days pass by. Grey and everyone go to a
      park for stephine's and her sister's better mentelaty. Their health seems
      to be improving. Grey was wearing a bandage in his heads. He removed it
      and asked ali how he was doing and ali explained that he can walk but that
      certain pain on his leg and hand is still visible. Grey tells everyone to
      meet at the big faris wheel if they split up. They didn't said this for
      more than 5 seconds they already all got lost. That was expected. They
      were split up in groups. Arvin with stephine Griffin, grey, stephine's
      sister and aria and ali together. Grey could see them but decided to let
      the missunderstanding depen cause it'll help them what they innitially
      planned out. Grey then visited some short of circus with griffin and they
      endered an empty place which made both grey and griffin dissopointed cause
      the circus was about to start about three hours later at night. Those guys
      in the circus looked preety suspicious. On a different side arvin and
      stephine argue cause both of them can't stand eachother. But looks like
      someone came to kidnap stephine this triggered stephine's truama. She fell
      on the ground. On a different side ali and aria were walking and they saw
      some people that are suspecious and aria asked why they are running away
      and ali explains that those guys looks awfully similer. He doesn't want to
      meet them again. They lack man power. On this side grye saw the man who
      was coming for stephine's sister who was in grey's arms. Grey gave her to
      griffin and told him to run cause things are about to go messy. On a
      different side on roof or something akio's guy was watching grey handing
      stephine's sister to griffin and he started running.
      <br />
      <br />
      Akio's guy told his men to capture that kid. Which order was delevered.
      Akio's guy knew that kid is truble and if he's here the police must be
      here. How did grey realize this was their supply house. On top of that
      akio is also here. He went to warn akio.

    <h2>Arc 10- The final conclution.</h2>
    <p>
      Griffin runs off with stephine's sister and grey wstopps that guy who was
      after her and that guy got violent and pointed a knife at grey and grey
      put his hands up. He said not to be violent cause they are all goanna get
      blown up. All of them pointed gun at grey. Just cause those idiots have
      guns doesn't mean their aim will get any better. A guy was about to shoot
      but he got shot insted. It was something powerful but not bullet. Grey put
      his hands down. On this side ali's group got caught and ali can't fight so
      ali suggests aria to get out of there. That guy came again to beat ali up
      and this time ali had a shot gun. Teaser. He managed to take one down. He
      had all shorts of gadegets now. He won't loose. On this side that guy who
      was came for stephine was slapped by arvin. He one shotted him. Stephine
      thought that arvin was reliabel. A few other guys came and arvin's some
      other three friends came who thought arvin was trying to flex in front of
      her which made arvin angry. They are still in coming. On this side ali
      started to loose an told aria to run and aria really did and ali managed
      to stood up and cut one person's throte. He flt wrong but he had no other
      options. On this side grey was seen smiling. He shouted that he has more
      than a thousand drones sorrunding this entire building. That's why he sold
      his entire house after all. If any of them would dare to even put their
      hands on the trigger. they'll get shot. Another guy tried shooting grey
      which turned horribly wrong. That guy was desimated. Everyone was forsed
      to put their guns down and a lot of leasers were pointing at them. Seems
      like late but the police came to aid. They came to arrest those people. On
      a different side arvin's group were facing guys who were no match for them
      cause they are preety strong but the police came anyways for protection.
      <br />
      <br />
      On another side ali manages to hold them off and the police came to aid.
      Ali thought they are goanna arrest him for what he did but even they know
      ali did it for self defence which is totally legal. He'll just need to
      clearyfy that it was for self defence later and he'll be free to go.
      Griffin comes to the place and asks where aria went and ali explains that
      he needs to go see her. Griffin leaves stephine's sister to one of the
      police officers and ali goes to see aria and griffin goes to see grey. The
      whole curcuis is filled with drones with alex on the controll. He
      remembered when they talked with grey. Grey explained that those drones
      are capable of making anyone fall asleap. They posses a little place where
      it shoots water like substance which is sleeping gas in liquid format.
      It's so fast that it hurts like bullet but the person won't die unless a
      huge amount of bullet is shot at someone at a singuler point. Other than
      that it's not possible to kill someone with that much pressure. Alex asked
      why grey funded his entire hosue for something they should and grey
      explains that he knew that whatever will happend needs to happen past. He
      can't wait for permission or explanation. So there is goanna be a carnival
      tyrpe place in the city for some short of celebration that happends every
      year but this year they are goanna catch a serial killer. Grey rememberd
      when robert had some short of clothing to his shoes that were wet and grey
      figured that it was some short of place with working and grey travelled
      the entire city to figure out where the place is. Honestly grey found
      three places. One, where a marrage is being held. Second, a cricket game
      and the third one is carnival that is never closed after few years ago.
      Grey went there to check things and it seemed ok until he used his drones
      and using austin's help he figured that there are actually school
      students, criminals and other stuff going on. And after the rechearch of
      few weeks they figured out the exact date of their shipment of drugs where
      akio himself will be present.
      <br />
      <br />
      Turns out the circus had a preety messed up baground and grey did heard
      his home room teacher talk about people doing stuff around those place.
      Austin was surprised when he heard that and grey explains that there are
      some stuff that the local knows more than the police are aware of. Mostly
      cause it's not part of their investigation or they are going out of their
      way or heck even they do democricy and get paid for keeping their mouth
      shut. Grey figured that robert had been there from the dirt of his shoes
      and his part fabric that he found. Grey knows the perfect date for the
      assult. It's goanna be a family trip when they see stephine or her sister
      they'll order her to be targetted cause only if akio or someone that
      understands who stephine or her sister is then it's game over. Everything
      confrimed. They need to oposition or permission to invaide cause they were
      attacekd. If they only captured them in the name of invation then they'll
      get out of the police station on bail like it was their normal daily
      routine. While the rest will go alert. And they would have no option but
      to run after they know they screwd up. So they'll need to cover up the
      underground place they dug up. Steven asks how grey knew about the place.
      Grey explained that he and austin holded the old builder and took the blue
      prints along with he talked to the neighbour shops if they do
      constructions and based on their answer they likely made a tunnel that
      connects a certain parking lot outside the field. Alex started clapping.
      He said that grey certainly had done good investigation. Alex says that so
      they'll sorrund them while they think they have no danger. Grey says that
      there is a possiblility they'll get alerted when they see grey but even if
      they do they'll be covering the entire place mean time. Now at the present
      akio was fleeing.
      <br />
      <br />
      After he heard from his right hand man about it and akio said that he
      won't go without him and he explained that they have only one chance.
      Their secret passageway is also blocked. Only option for akio is run and
      he'll take care of things. Akio without his will went. Akio's guy went to
      fend of invaider. That's when same came to actions. On this side akio ran
      for what he could. On a differnt side aria was running best she could. She
      thought that there is no need for her to run anymore cause she had alreayd
      passed them but where can she go? A nearby police station? But she needs
      to figure if stephine is ok or not. She bumps into akio and akio gives a
      shady smile. Ali went there from a different side and was wondering where
      aria was. Seems like he's quite lost right now. He met arvin and both of
      them heard aria's scream. They both rusehd to that place and turns out
      akio got his hands on someone. Arvin was so angry that he went on to fight
      him. Cause akio was crushing aria's moutes. Grey was running to the place
      where he saw akio last week and knows where their main base is and on this
      side sam started fight with that guy and grey reaches in time to combo
      with sam. grey and sam vs akio's guy on this side arvin and ali vs akio
      but they lost. Grey and sam took their revenge for austin but arvin and
      ali failed to protect aria. Grey and sam won their battle against akio's
      guy but this side arvin got laid.
      <br />
      <br />
      He still wasn't done. He was srawling to protect her but he was just too
      strong. Akio captured arai, took a jeap type car and flew over the gates
      and fleed knowing that he needs a hostage to get out. The fights came into
      a conclution. Akio's guy was caught. Akio fleed. More than 500 people were
      caught. 227 of them were under 18 who got caught for doing illigal stuff
      like drugs. Abusement. Arvin couldn't protect aria and he was so angry
      that he slapped grey and told him that what he was thinking. He trusted
      them too much. He couldn't protect anyone. Arvin was blamming himself. If
      aria dies what'll he do knowing he himself had the chance do anything but
      failed. It was his plan that put everyone in danger. Grey tells arvin that
      he'll save aria. If he gets the chance he'll do it no matter what. Even if
      he has to die for it. Arvin slaps grey for it again and says him not to
      give wierd commitments. He knows grey that he isn't saying this for fun.
      He'll littelery give up his life. Arvin is angry at grey for loosing aria.
      But he isn't telling him to throw away his own life. Grey tells alex that
      he has some questioning to do with akio's guy. Alex was talking about what
      questions to ask and grey says that he already knows everything. He didn't
      spend the last month scraching his balls. Stephine and her sisters were
      quite sad for evrythign had ahppend. They were at aria's house.
      <br />
      <br />
      They were the one's who were supposed to get kidnapped but it caused aria
      the harm. She apologises to her parents and her parents told her that it
      has nothing to do with her. It was cause her faith was so bad. Griffin
      watched over arvin and ali again. He was worried that they visited the
      hospital so many times since last week. On this side grey was talking to
      akio's guy. He talekd to him. He pronounced his full name. Grey tells him
      that there once was a magical note book that was capable of killing anyone
      that had one's name written. Only thing you need was the face and the
      name. The same in real like. All you need is the name and the face to know
      everything or kill them from inside ofcourse. Grey reveals that he had a
      wife and two kids but one day they suddenly got killed. After a few weeks
      he dissepeared from his village and the day he dissepeared another guy
      went missing. It was 19 years ago. at first grey thought that he was the
      person who killed his wife but he found himsef very much wrong at that
      discovery. Akio's guy's back story is seen. He was dealing with guns since
      a long time. He had a partner. And one enimy that blocked his goals. They
      usually used to fight but other than that they weren't really that bad at
      reltaions. After a few days a guy died and his wealth went to his father
      back insted of going to his daughter which was due to not doing proper
      will. Both the killer and his enimy went to take all the lands and
      everything and started fighting over it. After a few days while they were
      still at their fight they got a call from akio. Akio wanetd help.
      <br />
      <br />
      SO he went to help him outside the village. His enimy entered the hosue
      then but when he returend his wife was dead along with his kids. He was
      furious and he was told by his partner that it was his enimy that killed
      his wife and eveyrhting so he went to kill that guy but he was stopped by
      his partner cause they were brothers. Akio's guy was shocked but he
      decided to forgive but he didn't forgive the guy who killed his wife. The
      guy whom he sold gun in the very first day. It was cause he wanted to
      check it. The real reason was he got less land. Akio's guy then created a
      fake case, killed the real criminal mean while and then left the city when
      the case got closed. Akio's guy then went outside the town with his friend
      and decided to take over a lead since he didn't had any family anymore. He
      became more furious and more hostile and everything. He still blammes
      himself for his family. Only if he had a normal job insted of his wrong
      way of doing thing. He took over his enimie's men and created a huge
      organization. Both brother's later became the people who assulted jessika
      but since akio became heartless and so he killed his enimy which he wanted
      for so long after his friends got killed and he let him die. Grey knew
      eveyrthing and he wanted to know where akio is and that guy told grey a
      location that he could be. other than that he doens't knows where he could
      be. On a different side aria's father got a call from the killer and he
      rushed to meet grey. Grey heard that her father wanted to meet grye. Grey
      didn't wanted to meet him cause he didn't knew what he would do cause of
      anger. Alex was confused.
      <br />
      <br />
      He asked grey why would he be angy and grey explained that it's cause it
      was his fault techinically that she got abducted. Alex told grey that
      those words that alio told grey was out of anger. He didn't ment any of
      those to him. Grye realized that he missunderstood him and said that he
      isn't sure if that's the truth and one this alex realized that grey still
      haven't went over his truama. He's playing tough but if he continues like
      this he'll fall in depression and then die at a young age. At such state
      he should spend most amount of time with friends or lovers but grye's
      creating an invisible barrier with himself and others missunderstanding
      stuff. Alex wonderes if stephine coming to grey's life will remove the
      walls or add more layers. Grey left that place and went to his local
      vending machine for some drink and aria's father went to steven and he
      rushed to grey's location. Even he wondered if aria's father was angry at
      grey. Grey was watching kids play at the park until they ran away seeing
      aria's father. Grey thought he was about to be killed by him but turned
      out he was worried about grey and told grey that he recieved a threat
      video. It said that grey will need to come to a ceratin place alone if he
      wishes to get back aria and he won't tell his location. He'll need to
      figure it out on his own cause they must have had akio's guy expose him
      already. Akio also says that if they don't bring something worth valuable
      then he'll kill both of them. Grey thinks a bit and tells her father that
      he thinks that he knows where akio is. Her fater felt shameless to ask
      grey such thing but he told grey to save his daughter.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey says he'll. The father was going to bring some money but grey says
      that he'll manage. Cuase he was maybe somewhat responcible for everythign.
      On a different side stephine was completey unaware of everything. She
      heard news about steven and she's still confused but she has decided not
      to fall for lies anymore even if it means to be unresonable. She'll stay
      strong. At least for nola that's for sure. She wondered how many times her
      mother tried telling her about her father but why didn't she believe her.
      No, she told everything to her but she didn't willing to believe it cause
      she didn't accept the fact that she was fatherless when her father was
      just away from home. She knew that it was normal for some perople and she
      was so rute to her mother until the end. She's truely regretting it. Ali
      was supposed to be released today. Griffin and arvin went to see him and
      grey isn't picking pu his phone along with ali. What's going on. They
      reach the hospital and sam meet them. To all of their surprise ali and
      grey went somewhere alone. This made them question what they are planning.
      On top of that ali is injured. Sam calls alex and alex tells sam to return
      to their base cause they won't be doing anything anymore. The case will
      end in a few hours if they are lucky. This made sam confused. On this side
      ali and grey were walking up to akios' place. It wasn't the place where
      akio's guy said. Grey explained that he figured the place to be near the
      place where akio originally had his base but it's near the train station
      or something cause grey figured out the place seeing the baground. And
      grey knew what kind of construction they are doing.
      <br />
      <br />
      On top of that even if he was wrong the police are already working on
      tracking the car using satelite car tracking which will expose his
      location so even if they are wrong then the police will take care of
      things. Ali asks why grey is taking such risk. Grey explains that it would
      determine if it'll be worth risking his life or not. Is he really worth to
      live by letting someone else figure it out and then survibe or die proving
      that he had some worth. Not to someone else but it's entirely something
      self goal. On top of that akio specifiqly told grey to do it. Ali told
      grey not to die. He doesn't need to be a hero. Grey says that it's 100%
      upto fate. That's just some words ment for coincedences. If coincedences
      are by his side then someone will live in exchange of his and if it isn't
      then he'll live but someone else will die. Aria's father was confronted by
      ali and griffin. Ali was trying to rush for where ever he wanted to but
      sam stopped him. Ali said that that ididot is going to kill himelf. That
      killer won't let any of them live. All three are goanna die. He can't do
      anything. He wants to see the video and wants to figure things out. Sam
      plays the video and figuerd that it's near a train station but where. Near
      a constructing building. They realize that they can use satelite maps
      which was confusing but sam remembered that he knows a place where akio
      might be so he used that town as a refrence and saw where there was train
      station and found it. He then looked throw various houses near and founded
      the location. Sam found the location. on this side alex also found the
      location.
      <br />
      <br />
      All three of them were right on target. On this side it turns out grey
      used the same method as sam to figure out the place. Grey entered the
      building while ali stayed outside. On a different side arvin said that he
      won't accept anything. He'll go with them no mater what. Sam agrees and
      griffin remembers when grey said that he'll meet him in the oter side if
      anything happends to him. They all make a jourty to meet at that place.
      Grey entered the place and saw some stupid things lying on ground and akio
      saw grye and asked him if he came alone. Grey explained that he didn't. He
      brought a diseased paitent here to see things throw. Right now grey is
      holding a drone that'll shot akio if he by anychance does anything to
      them. Grey has the controller and he'll throw it to akio if he lets aria
      go. Akio asks why he didn't fired them already. Grey explained that they
      can't kill anyone. Even with rapid shot it can only injure someone and
      give them pain but not kill. Akio asked what grey will do after he
      releases aria and grey explains that he'll give him his remote if he has
      his hands out of her. Then if he lets her go then he'll give his pendent
      which is actually a pendrive. Akio remembers that pendrive. Griffin once
      showed it to him. Grey then tells akio that then aria will preacefully go
      down stairs where ali will take her to home with him but in any case they
      are confronted with major problem or their connection get's cut out then
      akio'll be chased by police. He definetely doesn't want to be chased by
      police in this town cause they have preety bad roads and even if akio
      managed to escape his entire identity of being maxin will be already
      revealed and also, he'll be injected with tracking stuff which are preety
      small for him to notice.
      <br />
      <br />
      maybe one is sticking in his hair right now and he isn't even noticing or
      it's just a mere blueff. It's all depened on akio to choose from. Akio
      chooses to let aria go and grey lets akio have the drone controller. Akio
      realizes that he can't controll the drone in time cause he doesn't knows
      the controlls. By that time both of them will escape. Grey figued that
      this building is also filled with people so if he even decided to mess
      with akio then they won't be able to escape. On top of that they don't
      even have any veichel. Aria left and akio saw that with his own eyes. Akio
      then came closer to grey and grey gave him his pendent. Akio then put grey
      to sleep with hammering his head with his gun cause he can't kill him
      right now. On this side aria was feeling guilty cause grey's life is in
      danger for hers and they'll kill him. Ali explains that they can do all is
      pray right now that nothing like that happens cause there isn't really
      much they can do other than running. So they keept running. on this side
      akio was checking the usb and he was fasinated. 13.3 million us dollers in
      digital wallet. Real money. Akio planns to leave. But grey escaped the
      place and he went as high as possible to the roof top where he found a
      iron crowbar and decided to use that if he wishes to escape. Akio went to
      the roof with some of his men. There was a helicopter there and grey
      decided ride it and distroy it. Apperently akio didn't had the keys there
      and the pilot was there alone. Grey told the polit to fly the helicopter
      but the pilot refused so he hit him on the head then used the gun there to
      shot the helicopter while he turned it on and shot it causing it to
      explode and unable to fly. On this side ali was picked up by alex and sam
      where arvin was.
      <br />
      <br />
      they were shocked to see that grey managed to do what he promiced. They
      decided to rush towards the battle scean. They'll sorrund this entire
      area. On this side akio was worried about his escape. He told grey nice
      job for ruining his flight bue he has more than one way to escape but grey
      didn's even decided to explain anything and decided to pull out a knife
      and also they are sorrunded by drones. Alex was in the controll room. Akio
      thought there were only one drone. Grey explained that he managed to sneak
      in 10 drones while they are bringing more. The moment they released aria
      it brought thousandws of drones towards them. And now they are at the roof
      top shooting over and over. Grey jumped from the roof which was 4 stories
      high. Grey landed on a dust bean. Apperently all the junk were able to
      keep grey alive but he'll probapally know what bones he cracked when he
      visit the doctor. If he survibes untill then. The entire building was
      filled with people. They orderred to capture grey but at that moment grey
      was standing in front of thousands of people he decided to bring out his
      drones and knfies cause he'll stand even if he has to fight alone. At that
      moment a lot of police car made it there. Among them were sam and a huge
      shooting started. Grey made his way to somewhere else. He was lost throw
      his way out. On a different side grey was slow cause his legs hurt a lot.
      He faced some people but he still made it out. Griffin was there and he
      went after grey and arvin also there with griffin. ali and aria were being
      taken home cause they are injured and everything. On this side sam rushes
      to the building inside he recieved an insider plan from alex that
      indicated that there could be a secret place just like in the carnival.
      This time they don't have it covered.
      <br />
      <br />
      Sam asks where grey went and alex explains that he went out to a bunker
      typle place where they kept a lot of firing power with humen trafficing
      subjects. Sam didn't udnerstood. Alex explained that when grey entered the
      place he made sure his rechearch in two hours and he gathered enough
      rumours and facts about the place being people getting lost and
      everything. And connected a connection and founded the exact place where
      they were kept. Sam didn't understood why he's telling him now. They
      should send a group to there right now. Alex explained that he had already
      send two groups of police there so no problem. On this side sam reaches
      akio and started fighting him but things were falling apert giving akio
      the chance to find his way to the place. Akio was going to a completely
      differnt room than they anticipated. Where could he going. Is it a room
      filled with guns or anythign like that. Or could it be a hostage room or
      the real escape room is somewhere different place but turns out akio was
      going to release a lot of water causing sam to fall apart. Then akio was
      getting away. Sam told his men to look after akio. They'll capture him no
      matter what. On this side grey was running at somewhere and arvin and
      griffin almost caught up to him and they told grey to stop but he didn't.
      Slowly they reached grey and grey explained that there is a room filled
      with people out there with hostages and bombs. If he doesn't does anythign
      then the bomb will go off and cause a lot of people to die. Arvin implys
      that it could be a lie and grey says that he doesn't cares if it's a lie
      or not. he's going to make sure that the place is safe. Grey then takes a
      different route and arvin was confused. He asked where grey was going and
      grey explained that he is going to a different placece if they want to
      follow him then they can. So they decided to follow grey. on this side
      sam's guys find akio and they find him in a wierd room where he's lost
      among dirt and they got shot one by one and by the time sam came it was
      all messed up. Akio kept running. on this side the police were fighting
      the criminals and they were aided by a lot of robots but the enimies
      decided to use water flow to damage the drones but they had enough drones
      to lit up the entire building infire so they won't have any option but to
      use the water else where.
      <br />
      <br />
      On this side akio and sam fight again and they were in a wierd room filled
      with stuff and they bounce and everything and sam was holding high. On
      this side grey and all three of them reach a room where it was all filled
      with guns and everything. Grey even found the entrence of everything
      that's on top. Grey found the bombs and on a differt side those two teams
      that found the hostages went the right place saved them. On this side sam
      was on the edge but akio still managed to run throw the tunnel he created
      but on this side grey with the help of griffin managed to tie down all the
      bombs to create a huge explotion causing the entire bulding to collaps. On
      this side akio inspite of the earthquacke and sound tried reaching the end
      of the tunnel and he fell and fell into the building colapsing. He was too
      injured. Grey then pointed one of the guns at him and told him that he's
      using on of his own guns. His own building to let him see the other side.
      Bang. Nothing happend. The gun was empty. Griffin tells akio that he
      doesn't wish to even see akio on the other side. Turned out akio was
      cushed too much to even walk. He died there. But before diying he thought
      everythign back. His life. Was it something he wanteed. Akio thought how
      back he was just a nerdy student who was never appreciated by his family.
      His younger broter recieved more praise than him even though he was
      worthless. Akio met griffin who wanted to be rich. Akio wanted to find
      peace and a lover. He was good at computer and griffin asked akio to teach
      him how to use it. They talk abnd became best of friends.
      <br />
      <br />
      Griffin was famous among his classmates. He had futuristic vision. He
      created a company with akio where he handeled the browser thing. While
      there were a lot of member in his company. He won't be able to pay them
      rtight now but if the company grows then they'll all be employed. That's
      where steven came to play. He was the styler of the company. And there
      were other people with the roles too. There was one preety girl named
      camilio who also had a good rolse but akio had a crush on her. But people
      didn't treated him like anything. No one treated him like a person as if
      he never existed. He was treated like he was griffin's pet. It made him
      angry but then again he knew that griffin never treated him wrong. Matter
      of fact he considered him his best friend. One year later the company fell
      and everything went aprt but griffin managed some money enough to
      celebrate a party. He was not sad cause he failed matter of fact the
      facinations and the possibilities that he discovered during his time with
      the company made him go curious. He has many ideas and knew one of them
      had to fail. He'll work harder and harder and will become rich. Turns out
      being rich isn't that hard if you know the way to utilize your way out. In
      that party akio told griffin that he liked camilio and griffin told akio
      that he should talk to her and akio was afraid cause he didn't wanted to
      be rejected. In that party steven was also there and talked to grey that
      he's looking forward to his next project. Then the party was going on
      steven was spreading news how griffin was clumshy and everything and
      they'll made mistakes. He's famous among girls. Griffin talked to steven
      about something. It's probapally secret. Then after a week when akio's
      family recieved a news about akio failing in grades. Akio managed to get
      good grades but his parents were one sided. Akio was super depressed.
      <br />
      <br />
      He wanted to end his life cause he feels worthless. He's being a buren to
      everyone but griffin called akio. Grffin wanted to make akio meet camilio.
      They talk and griffin went home and they spend the entire day as a date.
      After the date akio change ontacts and he was looking forward to future
      dates. Akio met griffin and he was super happy to know griffin managed
      such thing. Griffin explained that anything for his friend. Steven was
      also there. Griffin explained that he told steven to make a contact with
      camilio to be with akio and she was intrested. Akio was so happy that he
      told griffin thank you while crying. Then after a few years things started
      going right. Akio got good and he felt like people finally recognized him.
      He felt that people were nice towards him. Then he went to his parents and
      found out that they weren't taht bad at all. Maybe he was just looking the
      world throw a different way. Maybe he's just thinking everything is
      negetive cause he wasn't happy. Maybe his paren't were too bad. Maybe
      everyone is not bad. Everything is making him fooled for so long. Akio was
      so happy to face happyness. They started a new project and akio had a good
      role in it but he switched roles with some cause he wasn't confident and
      didn't wanted griffin to loose all his progress cause of his confusion.
      Griffin told akio that he should feel like he's too responcible. He can't
      be perfect. He'll have pressure but the best thing is to do is give our
      all. That's how they can do it. there's nothing more they can do about it.
      akio was having hard time understanding.
      <br />
      <br />
      Griffin then gave akio the payment he deserved. Even though akio didn't
      wanted to recieve it griffin was too nice to him. But after only a few
      years into stuff camilio broke up with akio and she said sorry to him.
      Grffin told akio to stay calm and everything. That's what happend. Aki
      thought that he was a fool to think he could satisfy someone like her's
      need. He's a falure after all. Griffin explains that it's not always like
      that. Sometimes people just want someone to be a certain type. At least
      that's for girls. For boys like them all it needs is for someone they
      think will help them sustain themselves is all they need. For girls
      everything matter. Don't get disscouraged for that. Then griffin relocated
      his office. He hired people took a lot of loan and everything. He had
      anticipated three original owners to the company right now. Griffin being
      the owner of everything and akio and steven being his partners. Steven
      will be the ceo and grffin behind everything. Akio will be a bourd
      director but akio couldn't go to a different place cause his family didn't
      gave him enough money to do so and griffin said that he didn't have enough
      but they can manage. Then akio found that his family refuses to give him
      permission to go there cause there is no future in it. Akio was so heart
      broken that he couldn't go to a entirely differnt country. Even he has
      started to doubt things. akio's friend then came to console akio that
      it'll be alright. Griffin came to see akio and he was angry to see akio's
      guy. He told akio not to meet with him for so many times. He's ruining him
      in a lot of ways. akio said he likes him but he'll try to avoide his bad
      habits. Griffin said now to be even near him. He litterlery commited a
      murder a few days ago.
      <br />
      <br />
      Akio was shocked to hear that. He asked how griffin knows it before the
      polcie and griffin explains that when a murder happens most of the time
      someone knows that it happend but most of the times people are too afraid
      of the people cause considereing what kind of democretic country they are
      in anytime they can be killed and no onw ill know. Griffin doesn't likes
      being near him. He's scary. And one last thing. Camilio proposed to
      griffin. After hearing that akio was broken but then he was happy. He
      asked griffin that's great news but griffin says that he is planning to
      refuse it but akio tells griffin not to do it cause he's perfect in every
      way. He deserves her more than him. And after arguing for a while griffin
      says that they will probapally break up but in case they don't sorry to
      akio. Akio said that he wants the best for griffin. Then griffin left.
      Akio was so sad that he couldn't explain but he was happy for griffin.
      After that three years pass by. Akio remembered how griffin told akio that
      he can go to him whenever he thinks he will or get permission for. Akio
      still didn't got permission for it. Akio got low test results so he
      couldn't get a proper jo and still suffering. His parents refused to let
      his study non govt cause it costs too much money. 40 lakh. He kept
      applying for jobs and everything. Today his brother's test result came in
      and he failed but his father told him nothing and said that he would admit
      him to non govt no matter how much money they need. Akio told his father
      that he needs that money to go to a differnt country. His friend griffin
      is holding a job for him. And he's giving it to his brother now who is a
      bigger falure than him. Akio's father was sure that he won't spend a
      single thing for him cause when the time came he dissopointed him and
      everything. This raged akio and he single handendly killed his entire
      family. He was so raged for it. He didn't regreted a single second
      torturing them. Then when they were dead akio thought what can he do now?
      He killed them. He killed them. He didn't knew what to do. He wanted to
      call griffin cause he was always there for him. Akio insted calls his
      right hand mand and tells him that he needs help to hide the bodies.
      <br />
      <br />
      They hide the bodies and akio meet up with his right hand man and decide
      what to do. Akio is truamatized cause he killed his own family and he has
      this guilty feeling. he wondered to get back to griffin but he can't
      anymore. He's a criminal now. Even if he pretended that everything was
      right he knows that it isn't and griffin will figure it out no matter how.
      Akio's guy told akio that no matter what he does he can no longer be what
      he wanted to do. What he can do is now be the kind of the chair he was
      building and be a criminal with him. Akio asked why he's giving him such
      high priority. He explained that he wanted someone to be a partner in
      crime with him cause he was lonely. Years pass by and everything happend.
      Griffin almost forgot about akio and had a family constuced and came back
      to his old town with his family where he moved and went to his father's
      house to onlly meet a child that was told to take care of cause apperently
      his father named everything on his name. Appertly griffin wasn't a good
      son and only was after success that he forgot people. Grffin thought that
      it was true but he doesn't want to believe it. He decided to take care of
      grey and after some time he realized that grey was a genious at everything
      but he was for some reason too causious of his sorrunding. Probapally too
      sentecive and he refuses to believe compliments. He thinks that someone is
      mocking him when he hears a compliment. Why he doesn't understood and
      griffin decided to do a will with stven that grey'll get all the property
      when he died.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grffin knows he shouldn't judge so soon but in case he dies right now
      it'll be secured cause grey is too nice with his family and everything. He
      always thinks of others before and too causious of spending even though he
      has the option to lead a rich lifestyle. Steven tried opposing the idea
      that he's giving a randome kid so much authority but griffin said that
      he's goanna change it when the time comes and griffin realizes that grey
      is not worth for everything he'll immidiately name everything his
      biological son's name. Griffin then went home and decided to show both
      sons everything about the company he had. grace was too bored but grey was
      curious. He saw various stuff and wanted to open one of the computers and
      then told to put it back and he at first made a mistake but later he
      fireut it out and he solved th problem. People say that computers are just
      lego's for adults. Grey says that things are facinating. He will not touch
      those stuff again untill he lerans more about those. Grey saw his father
      operating and then tried making the chart of daily skeduels sence and then
      steven said that grey is actually smart but grey heard that and asked
      steven if he was sleeping with a woman this morning who baked too much
      oily food. Steven didn't understood how grey figure that out and grey
      explained that his hair it got the touch of a woman and then it was
      setteled back by he himself. Grey remembers doing somethying like that
      when his mother did his hair and his shirt got a spot of oil. It isn't
      visible but grey can smell it. And also, there something that dosen't
      matches his body language. Grey asks if he ever tried liying. Griffin
      looked at steven and steven was at problem and said that he has to go to
      the toilet. Grey said that this room has toilte. Griffin tells grey taht
      he just wants to go to his comfortable place. Steven leaves. Grey wondered
      why griffin let him go.
      <br />
      <br />
      He could be plotting something against him. Griffin says that there are
      times when they need to do some pretedning cause they are friends and were
      there for eachotehr for so long. Grey says that just cause they have a
      favour to give eachotehr doesn't mean one will use that to backstab
      someone. Griffin said that steven didn't backstab him. Grey said that so
      he'll keep ignoring him? That's careless. Greiffin thought about it and
      told his secretery that he should keep an eye on steven on what he's
      doing. on a different side akio was called by steven which surprised him.
      Steven gave akio the contract to kill griffin and steven managed to
      manupulate him. Grey was being taken back along with austin was there for
      helping griffin but griffin said that he needs to meet someone. He was
      about to meet akio after so long. He wonderes what he's like now. He took
      grey with him. On this side austin went back and wondered what griffin
      wanted to go about. Griffin met akio and he brought him to a place that
      isn't good. He beat grey up and tied griffin down and akio explained his
      situation to griffin. Griffin was angry at him and asked what has he ever
      done to him to deserve such thing. Is he doing it for camilio? Akio
      explaines that it wasn't for camilio. It's for steven. Griffin tries
      telling him at least spare his son and akio hears that. Akio kills off
      griffin and wonderes what to do with grey. Akio's guy told akio that he
      was only told to kill griffin. There is no need to kill him. Akio was
      shocked to hear that. He asked why cause he's the one who always told him
      to finish up every suspect. Akio's guy told akio that maybe they have a
      debt to pay for griffin by leettting his son go. They didn't became
      killers cause they wanted to. It's something they had to become. Cuase
      they were involbed into these already. There is no coming back. They have
      no life from now on.
      <br />
      <br />
      A Day pass by for people to notice the dead body and grey's unconcious
      body. Austin came to rescue grye and saw griffin's death body. Austin took
      grey to the hospital and wondered what will happen to grey now and heard
      camilio getting worried about grey and griffin. She started crying on the
      otherside of the phone. Grace was sad. On this side when grey woke up he
      remembered fragments of what happen the last day. His father went
      somewhere to meet up a friend but who was it. He doesn't remembers. He
      told austin to take grey to home but then what. Why is he at the hospital
      now? Austin heard that grey forgot fragments of what happend the other day
      and the doctor explained that it isn't connected to his memory at all.
      It's just some normal forgetting of past events which are not considrerd
      important. He doesn't rememberes who griffin encountered. Matter of fact
      his confusion caused him to believe that he went home with austin but he
      didn't remembered that he was at the hospital. Did he fell from bed?
      Austin took grey home and then they were at griffin's furnerwell. It was
      done in private. Grey wondered that people die so easily. One moment after
      they meet the other they are 6 feets under. Then he went home to meet his
      mother and she hugged him immidiately then she was irritating feeling this
      made grey think that she's being angry at grey and they got into quareel
      and grey figured that he doesn't belongs to this house. Austin instantly
      came to the home to get grey but he wasn't home and austin found grey who
      was standing somewhere and he took grey to somewhere. Grey was wondering
      where he could be going and he was taken to but turns out griffin named
      everything to grey's name and grey wonderer what to do.
      <br />
      <br />
      He's now the new leader and grey said that he dosen't want to take the
      job. Steven is currently the ceo just announce him to be the leader. Of
      course grey'll still hold the authority to the entire company but steven
      will handel it behind the sceans. Steven was actually arguing that he
      should get the company but turns out that grey already gave him that he
      wanted. Austin didn't had anything against it cause even he knew that grey
      knows that he isn't capable to tackeling everything. Steven then pulls out
      the card that if that's the case then he'll need to name everything to
      steven cause that's part of steven's will. He already holds 50% share
      holder and handelling the enitre company will lead him to be the leader.
      He should by default be the owner and tells grey to sell him the rest of
      the company rights. He looks at austin and wishes to talk to his mother.
      Grey asked camilio that they have a huge debt right now and grey's
      planning to hand over everything to steven. Camilio thoought everything
      and thought that everyone is not griffin who can tackle everything. She
      doesn't want to sell the company but if steven is taking care of
      everything then things are sure to fall apart and it's better to get the
      money. The call ends and grey asks austin what he thinks is the best.
      Austin tells grey that he suggests grey to grow up and take care of
      everything insted of selling everything cause...grey inturupts it and says
      that his father died along with his legacy. He isn't even his biological
      son and he wants to pay every single debt griffin had so thier faimly
      could have a peace ful time. If he really will be a buisnessman like his
      father then one day he'll create his own. Steven was ready to meet grey
      and buy the company but grey said that he decided not to sell anything. He
      will hold the comapny with steven. Maybe things will be something grey
      doesn't understands but steven will be there for that. And also griffin
      had his own money vault.
      <br />
      <br />
      If he really meant everything will be grey's than grey'll use that to
      first get rid of all the loans and the remaining money can go for some
      months for their family. While working he's hoping to get paid. Cause it's
      techinically his company still. Steven liked that spirit of grey cause it
      was like griffin never left. He came back smaller and better. on this side
      grey's mother was angry at him cause he didn't sold the company and the
      stocks will go down if grey is on hold of it. It was better to sell them
      and why did he even decided to sell. On top of that he spend 90% of the
      family wealth on bank loans. Grey said that he didn't liked bank loans
      cause they have huge intrests. Right now or later he had to pay them but
      in a bigger format. He did the best paying it right now. On top of that
      they don't even have a proper job. Then when grey was sad for his mother
      being a bitch he created an image that she was a gold digger. Even thought
      that's just part true. Maybe not but grey has no way of conferming it.
      Then the next two years grey spend learning about the insider stuff about
      the comapny and everything. He decided to shif schools to near his work
      place and started living alone with austin who was investigating griffin's
      case. On this side akio was wondering alone and found camilio in a
      grossering shop. There they talk and akio proposes her. She rejects cause
      she is actually a very loyal person and a good person too but too bad of a
      mother which can't be helped. This side grey was doing his office thingi
      and he couldn't understand few stuff and asked his legal consultant to
      teach them those cause apperently schools aren't productive enough.
      Griffin's advicor told grey that akio was talking decisions about his
      ownership. Grey figures out that steven is actually planning to create
      democresy. Grey told his secretery to buy that share as soon as akio sells
      his share and not tell him anythign about it. he liked the idea.
      <br />
      <br />
      His advisor asked grey if he had enough money for it. Grey explained that
      he didn't had enough money at first but being the owner of a ceratin
      amount he can hold off unused money on a 50% share with steven so he's
      paying himself and other thing and the company growth has decreased 67%
      since griffin died but it constantly rised up again and again and now the
      company is only at 23%. It took a lot of effort to bring it back on track
      and grey tells his advicor that he didn't let camilio spend a single thing
      rather he told her straight forward to have her own job. She then kicked
      grey out of home. But he's still paying their electric and food charges.
      His advicor asked him what was the problem about. Grey asked if that man
      never got married and he said that he did and had a wife. She's still a
      nice person. Grey tells him that his mother is one of the kind person who
      loves to spend money. The dopamine it releases gives the same effect while
      gambeling. That's why those short of people are so aggresive when it comes
      to money. They know how to consume money and think that even though they
      work hard for it and spend it on useless stuff it still fells worth it to
      them which is confusing to grey. Working night and day for spend on sallon
      in a single day is too senceless. She can't argue with grey cause he'll
      never let her spend a single thing like that with his money even if she
      begged. After a month camilio bought a lot of stuff on his name that grey
      declined. She theretend grey but grey didn't listened. Grey will take the
      blame for now but right now he can't cause he wants the entire company
      back from steven. And be able to make enough money. Then maybe he'll be
      able to satisfy his family needs.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey get's a call from grace. It's his birthday. Grey decided to take a
      few days leave and then he went back to his family. His mother was happy
      to see him even though he thought she'd be angry at her. Grey said to his
      mother about his plans and everything. His mother said that she didn't
      expected griffin to cause such problem to them but she's with grey's plan.
      Grey tells camilio that they can go shooping today cause he's realizing
      that he's done nothing for camilio. This surely brought a smile at her
      moute and she went to shooping and it was surely a waste? no, as long as
      they are happy it's worth it. Grey decided to supply a certain amount to
      camilio's bank account every month so she can do everything herself and he
      askes grace to go to the office with him one day. Grace says that he
      doesn't want to. Grey then tells grace that he wants grace to take a hold
      of everything once he get's the company. He already made a will for grace
      that after him everything will go to him. Grace asks why and grey explains
      that cause he should always be the real inheritor of the company. And he
      tells grace to learn about buisness and everything. As soon as he does so
      he'll hand everything over to him. Grace rejects the idea cause father
      intrusted everything to him and grey says that and he trusts grace.
      Perhaps both brothers can take care of the entire thing and call thie
      company G brother's. Both brothers share dreams and Grey gave grace a
      working smart working watch. Grace always wanted one. This one is durable.
      Grace was happy. This made grey happy. They then went out to play with
      friends and all. On a different side akio was talking with steven. Steven
      realized that grey bought the 10% share that he sold for politics and
      steven is pissed.
      <br />
      <br />
      He wants akio to end camilio's bloodline. Akio thought about it and became
      heartless and accepted the comission. On this side as expected camilio was
      home alone making the cake. Grey was helping friends and everything. He
      went back to his school for a few days and said that he was doing ok in a
      foreign school and met grace's soulmate and everything. And as expected
      grey was out in the field and grace was going home cause he was tired. He
      met akio who asked him his way home. Grace took akio home and told his
      mother that someone came to meet her. She told grace to go to his room.
      Akio was inside her house with another guy. Camilio knew both of them.
      Akio was talking to camilio about her state and everything. Grace entered
      the room and camilio talked to akio about grace's birthday. Akio told
      camilio that happy birthday. Then akio's guy holded camilio's moute and
      then akio stabbed grace. He died. AKio told camilio that he wished that
      she was his. Maybe then he could have done something different. Akio
      killed her and while he was standing there a little girl came inside the
      home and saw the killers and ran away from the house. Grey was with her
      but both of them were too scared to enter the house. Grey decided to call
      the police. He felt selfish. That moment he felt selfish. His paretns were
      called dead by someone who witnessed it but he refused to check it out.
      Why? Was it cause he was sared. DId he became selfish? Grey was so broken
      after it he went to talk to that girl to know whose face she saw but turns
      out she got killed too. Grey was so scared that he sold his everything to
      steven. He wondered that steven was the one who was killing people but he
      isn't killing them directly. Grey doens't want to be invobled into
      anything and wants to pretend that he knows nothing.
      <br />
      <br />
      Maybe he can survibe that way. After hearing this excuse of grey steven
      was so happy that he decided to let grey live and told akio that he
      doesn't need to kill him anymore. Grey on this side was so scared to live
      alone that he once went to the police station and spend the night there. A
      few years passed and grey returned to his school and stephine met grey and
      he was so scared but he felt like something was jailing grey and grey
      already sold everything he didn't needed cause he didn't had the family
      for care. What's the point of so much moeny? He can spend it but for whom?
      He wants someone to be there. Someone. Kevin died then, Then a long time
      passed. Grey almost got rid of his truama and made himsef a joker among
      his friends to make sure that he forget's every bit of fear within
      himself. One day he got scared that he punched himsef hard to he doesn't
      feels the fear. He then got tired of everything. Maybe he wants to die. So
      he decided to figure out everythign about those people. Apperently austin
      left job cause he felt worthless not being able to solve it. Grey figured
      that he should try. He tried connecting the dots that steven is surely the
      killer. He called various people and then figured that akio was someone
      that he should know of cause he got lost rigt after some stuff. Grey
      figured that he has to go there physically to meet people and investigate
      to figure things out and it'll kill him. He got scared again. Grey then
      got hooked up with stephine and he figured that her smile is worth
      everyting.
      <br />
      <br />
      He then almost lost stephine and decieded to fight only himself alone
      cause if stephine is caught up then it'll be bad and now he's currently
      standing in front of akio's dead body. Grey said to akio's dead body that
      he won. Even though he didn't even fought the fight half. But he tells
      akio that he's sorry to himself for running from eveyrthing for so long
      but also appreciates it cause if that werent there then he would have died
      on so many occations from now. Grey fell unconcious and griffin holded
      him. He slep. The next day grey was at his new appartment. Grey said that
      loans are pretty scary when he saw stephine. She was there and hugged him
      and told grey that welcome back home. Stephine's sister was there too. A
      truck appears in front of the house. Griffin brought it. He told grey that
      he won't be keeping his stuff anymore. Grey then went to the hospital for
      check in. Ali and griffin came to meet him. That moment steven came to
      meet grey and he was quite surprised to hear everyhting and wanted to meet
      his daughter and grey gave steven a recording that was his which exposed
      him. Steven wanted to make his daughter marry grey so griffin's remaining
      stuff goes to steven cause after all the comapny was just 30% of what
      griffin had. Matter of fact grffin had other company shares and everything
      too which was inside grey's pendent. yet only the other person who knew
      about it was steven. Sometimes you know who your enimy is but there is no
      proff. Steven points a gun at grey cause he's exposed. Sam comes right at
      time and catches steven. He being caught grey wants the company back. And
      he aint not paying cause he's goanna be sentenced to death anyways. The
      court hearing is heard and it was a controverseal topic weather grey
      should recieve the company or not and grey explained that he's willing to
      pay for it throw shares cause his shares cost something but he can't sell
      them cause they'll loose their worth that is going high or low.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the end grey got it for free. A 10 year time skip happend. Everyone was
      living a happy life. And grey is doiing busy life. Too much suffering. On
      top of that his wife is just like his mother who spends a lot. A person
      tells grey that money can't buy hapiness. Grey tells him then give him the
      money cause he's working sweat everyday just for his wife to spend it on
      wierd stuff. That guy says that he doesn't understands but grey
      understands it more than anything. Money is worth it but only when he's
      spending it for his family and his family smile. Other than that even if
      he's spending it alone he won't realize the hapiness from just spending it
      for himself cause waht'll he do. By a car? Gaming pc? Or some other stuff.
      Then what? After a year or two it'll become normal thing to him and he'll
      get bored. That's the psychology of money. Grey goes back home and sees
      stephine's and his daughter's face and becomes happy. Working hard for
      money may not be worth it but a happy family is worth every bit of it.
